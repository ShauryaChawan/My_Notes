## Introduction

- A Database Management System (DBMS) is a software system that is designed to manage and organize data in a structured manner.
- It allows users to create, modify, and query a database, as well as manage the security and access controls for that database.
- DBMS provides an environment to store and retrieve the data in convenient and efficient manner.

## Key Features

- **Data modeling:** A DBMS provides tools for creating and modifying data models, which define the structure and relationships of the data in a database.
- **Data storage and retrieval:** A DBMS is responsible for storing and retrieving data from the database, and can provide various methods for searching and querying the data.
- **Concurrency control:** A DBMS provides mechanisms for controlling concurrent access to the database, to ensure that multiple users can access the data without conflicting with each other.
- **Data integrity and security:** A DBMS provides tools for enforcing data integrity and security constraints, such as constraints on the values of data and access controls that restrict who can access the data.
- **Backup and recovery:** A DBMS provides mechanisms for backing up and recovering the data in the event of a system failure.
- **DBMS can be classified into two types:** Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) and Non-Relational Database Management System (NoSQL or Non-SQL)
- **RDBMS:** Data is organized in the form of tables and each table has a set of rows and columns. The data are related to each other through `primary` and `foreign` keys.
- **NoSQL:** Data is organized in the form of key-value pairs, documents, graphs, or column-based. These are designed to handle large-scale, high-performance scenarios.

## Database Languages

1. Data Definition Language (DDL)
2. Data Manipulation Language (DML)
3. Data Control Language (DCL)
4. Transactional Control Language (TCL)
5. Data Query Language (DQL)

### 1. Data Definition Language (DDL)

- **Purpose:** DDL deals with database schemas and descriptions, of how the data should reside in the database.
- **Command Commands:**
  - `CREATE`: to create a database and its objects like (table, index, views, store procedure, function, and triggers)
  - `ALTER`: alters the structure of the existing database
  - `DROP`: delete objects from the database
  - `TRUNCATE`: remove all records from a table, including all spaces allocated for the records are removed
  - `COMMENT`: add comments to the data dictionary
  - `RENAME`: rename an object
- **Example:**
  
```sql
CREATE TABLE Employees (
  EmployeeID INT PRIMARY KEY,
  FirstName VARCHAR(50),
  LastName VARCHAR(50),
  HireDate DATE
);
```
This creates a new table called `Employees` with specified columns.

### 2. Data Manipulation Language (DML)

- **Purpose:** DML is used to manipulate the data stored in database objects like tables.
- Command Commands:
  - `SELECT`: Retrieves data from the database.
  - `INSERT`: Adds new records into a table.
  - `UPDATE`: Modifies existing data in a table.
  - `DELETE`: Removes data from a table.
- **Example:**

```sql
INSERT INTO Employees (EmployeeID, FirstName, LastName, HireDate)
VALUES (1, 'John', 'Doe', '2024-08-17');
```

This inserts a new record into the `Employees` table.

<hr/>

### 3. Data Control Language (DCL)

- **Purpose:** DCL is used to control access to data within the database.

- **Common Commands:**
  - `GRANT`: Provides specific users with access privileges to database objects.
  - `REVOKE`: Removes previously granted access privileges from users.
- **Example:**

```sql
GRANT SELECT, INSERT ON Employees TO user1;
```

This grants `user1` permission to select and insert data into the `Employees` table.

<hr/>

### 4. Transactional Control Language (TCL)

- **Purpose:** TCL is used to manage transactions in the database, ensuring that the data remains consistent.

- **Common Commands:**
  - `COMMIT`: Saves all changes made during the current transaction.
  - `ROLLBACK`: Undoes all changes made during the current transaction.
  - `SAVEPOINT`: Sets a savepoint within a transaction to which you can later roll back.
  - `SET TRANSACTION`: Sets characteristics for the transaction, such as isolation level.
- **Exmaple:**

```sql
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
    UPDATE Employees SET LastName = 'Smith' WHERE EmployeeID = 1;
    SAVEPOINT Save1;
    DELETE FROM Employees WHERE EmployeeID = 2;
ROLLBACK TO Save1;
COMMIT;
```

This starts a transaction, makes some changes, and then rolls back to a savepoint before committing the transaction.

<hr/>

### 5. Data Query Language (DQL)

- **Purpose:** DQL is used to retrieve data from the database. Although often considered a part of DML, it is specifically focused on querying.
- **Common Command:**
  - `SELECT`: Used to fetch data from one or more tables.
- **Example**:

```sql
SELECT FirstName, LastName FROM Employees WHERE HireDate > '2023-01-01';
```

This retrieves the first and last names of employees hired after January 1, 2023.

## History of DBMS

The history of DBMS evolved in three primary phases:

1. File-based System
2. Relational DBMS
3. NoSQL

## File System VS DBMS

| **Aspect**| **File System** | **DBMS** |
|---------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Data Storage**           | Data is stored in files, usually in a hierarchical structure. <br> **Example**: A directory containing text files. | Data is stored in tables, often with relationships between them. <br> **Example**: An `Employees` table in an HR database. |
| **Data Redundancy**        | High redundancy, as data is often duplicated across files. <br> **Example**: Employee information stored in multiple text files. | Redundancy is minimized through normalization and data integrity constraints. <br> **Example**: Employee information stored in a normalized table. |
| **Data Consistency**       | Difficult to maintain, especially with concurrent access. <br> **Example**: Different versions of a file might have conflicting data. | Ensures consistency through ACID properties and constraints. <br> **Example**: Consistent data updates across multiple tables in a transaction. |
| **Data Integrity**         | Hard to enforce; manual checks are often required. <br> **Example**: No automated way to ensure that employee IDs are unique across files. | Enforced through integrity constraints like primary keys, foreign keys, etc. <br> **Example**: A primary key constraint on the `EmployeeID` column. |
| **Data Access**            | Data access is sequential or direct but often less flexible. <br> **Example**: Reading a specific line in a log file. | Data access is more flexible, with complex queries supported through SQL. <br> **Example**: Querying all employees who joined after a specific date. |
| **Security**               | Security is limited to file-level permissions. <br> **Example**: Read/write permissions set on a file or folder. | Advanced security features like user roles, permissions, and encryption are available. <br> **Example**: Role-based access control in Oracle DB. |
| **Concurrency Control**    | Poor; file locking mechanisms can lead to issues like deadlocks. <br> **Example**: Two users trying to edit the same document simultaneously. | Advanced concurrency control mechanisms like locking, transactions, etc. <br> **Example**: Transaction locking in MySQL to prevent data corruption. |
| **Backup and Recovery**    | Manual processes are usually required. <br> **Example**: Copying files to an external drive for backup. | Automated backup and recovery options are typically built-in. <br> **Example**: Scheduled backups in PostgreSQL. |
| **Data Independence**      | Low; changes to data structure affect the application logic. <br> **Example**: Changing the format of a CSV file requires updating the script that reads it. | High; changes to data structure generally do not affect application logic. <br> **Example**: Adding a new column to a table without affecting existing queries. |
| **Querying**               | Limited to basic file searching and sorting operations. <br> **Example**: Searching for a keyword in a text file. | Powerful querying capabilities with SQL, supporting complex queries. <br> **Example**: Joining multiple tables to retrieve data in SQL Server. |
| **Performance**            | Performance can degrade with large volumes of data and multiple users. <br> **Example**: A slow file search in a large directory. | Optimized for handling large volumes of data with multiple users efficiently. <br> **Example**: Efficient indexing in a large-scale MySQL database. |
| **Data Relationships**     | No inherent support for relationships between data. <br> **Example**: Separate files for employee details and department details with no direct link. | Supports complex relationships (e.g., one-to-many, many-to-many) through foreign keys. <br> **Example**: A foreign key linking `Employees` and `Departments` tables. |
| **Data Model**             | Does not follow any specific data model. <br> **Example**: Flat file or hierarchical file structure. | Follows a specific data model (e.g., relational, NoSQL). <br> **Example**: The relational model in an Oracle database. |
| **Transaction Management** | Not supported or very limited. <br> **Example**: Manually saving versions of a document after each change. | Fully supports transactions with ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability). <br> **Example**: A multi-step transaction in PostgreSQL that can be committed or rolled back. |
| **Data Sharing**           | Data sharing is difficult and often requires manual intervention. <br> **Example**: Sharing a file via email or a shared drive. | Data is easily shared across different applications, with controlled access. <br> **Example**: Multiple applications accessing the same SQL database with appropriate permissions. |
| **Scalability**            | Scalability is limited and often requires significant manual effort. <br> **Example**: Splitting large files into smaller ones manually. | Scalable with distributed databases and clustering options. <br> **Example**: Scaling a MongoDB cluster to handle large amounts of data across servers. |
| **Example**                | Text files, CSV files, XML files. <br> **Example**: A CSV file storing a list of products. | Oracle, MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB. <br> **Example**: A MySQL database storing e-commerce data. |
