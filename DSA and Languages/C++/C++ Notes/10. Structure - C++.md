## What is a Structues?
- Unlike Arrays, Structures in C++ are user defined data types which are used to store group of items of non-similar data types

- In C++, classes and structs are blueprints that are used to create the instance of a class. Structs are used for lightweight objects such as Rectangle, color, Point, etc.

- Unlike class, structs in C++ are value type rather than reference type. 

- It is useful if you have data that is not intended to be modified after the creation of a struct.

## Declaring of a Structure

**Syntax 1:**
```
struct Point{
	int x, y;
};

int main(){
	struct Point p1;
}
```

In the above syntax, in the 'main()' funciton, the 'struct' eyword is optional in C++ but compulsory in C.
**Syntax 2:**
```
struct Point{
	int x, y;
}p1, p2;
```

## Initializing Structure Members

- Structure members cannot be initialized with a declaration. But it is considered correct in C++11 and above. For example, the following C program fails in compilation.
  
	**Example:** in C
	```
	struct Point
	{
        int x = 0; // COMPILER ERROR: cannot initialize members here
        int y = 0; // COMPILER ERROR: cannot initialize members here
	};
	```
	The reason for the above error is simple, when a data type is declared, no memory is allocated for it. Memory is allocated only when variables are created.

	**Example:** in C++
	```
	#include <bits/stdc++.h>
	using namespace std;


	struct Point
	{
        int x = 0; // It is Considered as Default Arguments and no Error is Raised
        int y = 1;
	};


	int main()
	{
        struct Point p1;


        // Accessing members of Point p1
        // No value is Initialized then the default value is considered. ie x=0 and y=1;
        cout << "x = " << p1.x << ", y = " << p1.y << endl;


        // Initializing the value of y = 20;
        p1.y = 20;
        cout << "x = " << p1.x << ", y = " << p1.y;
        return 0;
	}
	```
	Output:
	```
	x = 0, y = 1      
	x = 0, y = 20 
	```

- Structure members can be initialized using curly braces ‘{}’. For example, the following is a valid initialization.
  
	**Example:**
	```
	#include <bits/stdc++.h>
	using namespace std;

	struct Point {
		int x, y;
	};

	int main()
	{
        // A valid initialization. member x gets value 0 and y
        // gets value 1. The order of declaration is followed.
        struct Point p1 = { 0, 1 };
	}
	```

<hr/>

## Array of Structures

```
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;


struct Point {
    int x, y;
};
 
int main()
{
    // Create an array of structures
    struct Point arr[10];
 
    // Access array members
    arr[0].x = 10;
    arr[0].y = 20;
    
    arr[1].x = 30;
    arr[1].y = 40;
    
    arr[2].x = 50;
    arr[2].y = 60;


    for(int i = 0; i < 3; i++){
        cout << "(" << arr[i].x << ", " << arr[i].y << ") ";
    }
    return 0;
}
```
Output:
```
(10, 20) (30, 40) (50, 60)
```

<hr/>

## Structure Pointer

If we have a pointer to the structure, members are accessed using the arrow ( -> ) operator instead of the dot (.) operator.

```
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;


struct Point {
    int x, y;
};
 
int main()
{
    struct Point p1 = { 1, 2 };
 
    // p2 is a pointer to structure p1
    struct Point* p2 = &p1;
 
    // Accessing structure members using
    // structure pointer
    cout << p2->x << " " << p2->y;
    return 0;
}
```
Output:
```
1 2
```
