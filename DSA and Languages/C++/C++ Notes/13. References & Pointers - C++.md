## References

### Creating References
A reference variable is a "**reference**" to an existing variable, and it is created with the ***&*** operator:

```
string food = "Pizza";  // food variable
string &meal = food;    // reference to food
```
Now, we can use either the variable name food or the reference name meal to refer to the food variable:

```
string food = "Pizza";
string &meal = food;

cout << food << "\n";  // Outputs Pizza
cout << meal << "\n";  // Outputs Pizza
```
<hr/>

### Memory Address
In the example from the previous page, the & operator was used to create a reference variable. But it can also be used to get the memory address of a variable; which is the location of where the variable is stored on the computer.

When a variable is created in C++, a memory address is assigned to the variable. And when we assign a value to the variable, it is stored in this memory address.

To access it, use the & operator, and the result will represent where the variable is stored:
```
string food = "Pizza";

cout << &food; // Outputs 0x6dfed4
```

***Note:*** The memory address is in hexadecimal form (0x..). Note that you may not get the same result in your program.

***And why is it useful to know the memory address?***
References and Pointers (which you will learn about in the next chapter) are important in C++, because they give you the ability to manipulate the data in the computer's memory - which can reduce the code and improve the performance.
These two features are one of the things that make C++ stand out from other programming languages, like Python and Java.

## Pointers

### Creating Pointers

There are 3 ways of creating a pointer variable:
```
string* mystring; // Preferred
string *mystring;
string * mystring;
```

You learned from the previous chapter, that we can get the memory address of a variable by using the & operator:
```
string food = "Pizza"; // A food variable of type string

cout << food;  // Outputs the value of food (Pizza)
cout << &food; // Outputs the memory address of food (0x6dfed4)
```
A ***pointer*** however, is a variable that stores the memory address as its value.

A pointer variable points to a data type (like ***int*** or ***string***) of the same type, and is created with the ***'\*'*** operator. The address of the variable you're working with is assigned to the pointer:

```
string food = "Pizza";  // A food variable of type string
string* ptr = &food;    // A pointer variable, with the name ptr, that stores the address of food

// Output the value of food (Pizza)
cout << food << "\n";

// Output the memory address of food (0x6dfed4)
cout << &food << "\n";

// Output the memory address of food with the pointer (0x6dfed4)
cout << ptr << "\n";
```
***Example explained***

Create a pointer variable with the name **ptr**, that points to a **string** variable, by using the asterisk sign **'\*'** (***string* ptr***). 

**Note that the type of the pointer has to match the type of the variable you're working with.**

Use the **'&'** operator to store the memory address of the variable called **food**, and assign it to the pointer.

Now, ***ptr*** holds the value of food's memory address.

### Dereferencing - Get Memory Address and Value

In the previous example, we used the pointer variable to get the memory address of a variable (used together with the & reference operator). However, you can also use the pointer to get the value of the variable, by using the **'\*'** operator (the dereference operator):

```
string food = "Pizza";  // Variable declaration
string* ptr = &food;    // Pointer declaration

// Reference: Output the memory address of food with the pointer (0x6dfed4)
cout << ptr << "\n";

// Dereference: Output the value of food with the pointer (Pizza)
cout << *ptr << "\n";
```

<hr/>

### Modify the Pointer Value

You can also change the pointer's value. But note that this will also change the value of the original variable:

**Example:**
```
string food = "Pizza";
string* ptr = &food;

// Output the value of food (Pizza)
cout << food << "\n";

// Output the memory address of food (0x6dfed4)
cout << &food << "\n";

// Access the memory address of food and output its value (Pizza)
cout << *ptr << "\n";

// Change the value of the pointer
*ptr = "Hamburger";

// Output the new value of the pointer (Hamburger)
cout << *ptr << "\n";

// Output the new value of the food variable (Hamburger)
cout << food << "\n";
```
