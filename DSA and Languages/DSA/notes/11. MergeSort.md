- The Merge Sort algorithm is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that sorts an array by first breaking it down into smaller arrays, and then building the array back together the correct way so that it is sorted.

## How it works

- Divide the array into two halves recursively until each subarray contains only one element (which is trivially sorted).
- Merge the subarrays back together by comparing the smallest elements of each subarray and placing them in the correct order.
- Continue merging until the entire array is sorted.
