<hr>

- The Insertion Sort algorithm uses one part of the array to hold the sorted values, and the other part of the array to hold values that are not sorted yet.

## How it works

1. Start with the second element (assuming the first element is already "sorted").
2. Compare it to the elements in the sorted portion of the array (elements to its left).
3. Shift all larger elements one position to the right to make space.
4. Insert the element in its correct position.
5. Repeat for each subsequent element until the entire array is sorted.

## Time Complexity

- **Worst-case**: `O(n²)`, where n is the number of elements (when the array is reverse-sorted).
- **Best-case**: `O(n)`, when the array is already sorted (it only needs to make comparisons).
