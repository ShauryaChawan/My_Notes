[Link](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/weather-observation-station-5/problem)

```sql
-- Find the shortest city name
(SELECT CITY, LENGTH(CITY) AS LENGTH
 FROM STATION
 ORDER BY LENGTH(CITY), CITY 
 LIMIT 1)

UNION ALL

-- Find the longest city name
(SELECT CITY, LENGTH(CITY) AS LENGTH
 FROM STATION
 ORDER BY LENGTH(CITY) DESC, CITY 
 LIMIT 1);
```

Other Approach:

```sql
-- Query to find the city with the longest name
SELECT CITY, CHAR_LENGTH(CITY) AS LENGTH
FROM STATION
WHERE CHAR_LENGTH(CITY) = (SELECT MAX(CHAR_LENGTH(CITY)) FROM STATION)
ORDER BY CITY
LIMIT 1;

-- Query to find the city with the shortest name
SELECT CITY, CHAR_LENGTH(CITY) AS LENGTH
FROM STATION
WHERE CHAR_LENGTH(CITY) = (SELECT MIN(CHAR_LENGTH(CITY)) FROM STATION)
ORDER BY CITY
LIMIT 1;
```
