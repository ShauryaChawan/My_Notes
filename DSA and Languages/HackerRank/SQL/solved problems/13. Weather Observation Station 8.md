```sql
SELECT DISTINCT city FROM station 
WHERE 
SUBSTR(city, 1,1) 
IN 
('A','E','I','O','U')
AND
SUBSTR(city, LENGTH(city),1) 
IN 
('a','e','i','o','u');
```

OR

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT city FROM station 
WHERE 
LEFT(city,1) IN ("A", "E", "I", "O", "U") 
AND 
RIGHT(city,1) IN ("A", "E", "I", "O", "U");
```

Notes "Char" amd string comparison is same, also also case-sensitivity doesn't matter;
