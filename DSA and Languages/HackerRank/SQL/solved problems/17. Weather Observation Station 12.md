```sql
SELECT DISTINCT city FROM station 
WHERE 
SUBSTR(city, 1,1) NOT IN ('A','E','I','O','U')
AND
SUBSTR(city, LENGTH(city),1) NOT IN ('A','E','I','O','U');
```

OR

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT city FROM station 
WHERE 
LEFT(city,1) NOT IN ('A','E','I','O','U')
AND
RIGHT(city,1) NOT IN ('A','E','I','O','U');
```

Notes "Char" amd string comparison is same, also also case-sensitivity doesn't matter;
