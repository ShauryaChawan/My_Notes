## What is Java?
Java is the high-level, object-oriented, robust, secure programming language, platform-independent, high performance, Multithreaded, and portable programming language.

It is owned by Oracle, and more than 3 billion devices run Java.

It is used for:

- Mobile applications (specially Android apps)
- Desktop applications
- Web applications
- Web servers and application servers
- Games
- Database connection
- And much, much more!

## Why Use Java?
- Java works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc.)
- It is one of the most popular programming language in the world
- It has a large demand in the current job market
- It is easy to learn and simple to use
- It is open-source and free
- It is secure, fast and powerful
- It has a huge community support (tens of millions of developers)
- Java is an object oriented language which gives a clear structure to programs and allows code to be reused, lowering development costs
- As Java is close to C++ and C#, it makes it easy for programmers to switch to Java or vice versa

| Feature                           | Java                                                                 | C++                                                                 |
|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Language Type**                 | Object-Oriented: Focuses on classes and objects.                     | Multi-Paradigm: Supports procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming. |
| **Memory Management**             | Automatic: Uses Garbage Collection to handle memory automatically.   | Manual: Developers use pointers to manage memory, requiring careful handling to avoid leaks. |
| **Platform Dependency**           | Platform-Independent: Runs on the JVM, enabling cross-platform compatibility. | Platform-Dependent: Compiles directly to machine code, which may vary by platform. |
| **Performance**                   | Generally Slower: JVM introduces some overhead.                      | Generally Faster: Direct compilation to machine code enhances performance. |
| **Syntax**                        | Simple and Verbose: Easier to read but often requires more code.      | Complex and Less Verbose: Allows for more concise code but can be harder to read. |
| **Multiple Inheritance**          | Not Supported: Uses interfaces to achieve similar functionality.      | Supported: Allows a class to inherit from multiple classes, with mechanisms to resolve ambiguities. |
| **Pointers**                      | Not Supported: Java avoids direct memory manipulation for safety.     | Supported: Provides direct memory access, offering power but requiring caution. |
| **Exception Handling**            | Checked Exceptions: Exceptions must be handled or declared.           | Unchecked Exceptions: More freedom, but developers must manage exceptions carefully. |
| **Operator Overloading**          | Not Supported: Simplifies the language but limits custom behaviors.   | Supported: Allows custom behavior for operators based on operand types. |
| **Use Cases**                     | Web, Android Development: Ideal for cross-platform applications and enterprise-level software. | System Software, Game Development: Preferred for applications requiring high performance and control. |
| **Standard Library**              | Rich Standard Library (JDK): Extensive APIs for networking, I/O, etc. | Standard Template Library (STL): Includes data structures, algorithms, and more. |
| **Portability**                   | Highly Portable: The same code runs on different platforms via JVM.   | Less Portable: Platform-specific compilation may require code adjustments. |
| **Concurrency**                   | Built-in Multithreading: Strong support for concurrent programming.   | Platform Dependent: Concurrency often requires external libraries or OS-specific APIs. |
| **Templates**                     | Not Supported: Java uses generics, which provide similar functionality. | Supported: Enables generic programming, allowing code to work with any data type. |
| **Memory Access**                 | Restricted: No direct access to memory, enhancing safety.             | Direct Memory Access: Pointers allow for control and flexibility but increase the risk of errors. |
| **Compilation**                   | Compiled to Bytecode: Runs on JVM, adding abstraction but also overhead. | Compiled to Machine Code: Direct execution by the CPU, offering faster performance. |
| **Structures and Unions**         | Not Supported: Java only supports classes.                           | Supported: Provides structures for grouping variables and unions for memory optimization. |
| **Goto Statement**                | Not Supported: Java encourages structured programming without goto.   | Supported: Allows altering the flow of control, though often discouraged. |
| **Virtual Functions**             | Not Supported: Java uses method overriding in classes.               | Supported: Enables runtime polymorphism, allowing derived classes to override base class functions. |
| **Unsigned Right Shift Operator** | Supported (>>>): Java includes an unsigned right shift operator.      | Not Supported: C++ uses only signed shift operators. |
