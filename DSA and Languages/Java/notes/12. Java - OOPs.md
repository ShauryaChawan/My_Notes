## What is OOP?
OOP stands for Object-Oriented Programming.

Procedural programming is about writing procedures or methods that perform operations on the data, while object-oriented programming is about creating objects that contain both data and methods.

Object-oriented programming has several advantages over procedural programming:

- OOP is faster and easier to execute
- OOP provides a clear structure for the programs
- OOP helps to keep the Java code DRY "Don't Repeat Yourself", and makes the code easier to maintain, modify and debug
- OOP makes it possible to create full reusable applications with less code and shorter development time

**Tip:** The "Don't Repeat Yourself" (DRY) principle is about reducing the repetition of code. You should extract out the codes that are common for the application, and place them at a single place and reuse them instead of repeating it.

## 4 pilliars of OOPs

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that uses "objects" to model real-world entities and their interactions. It is centered around four main principles:

1. Encapsulation: 
   - Bundles the data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit called a class. 
   - It hides the internal state of the object from the outside world and only exposes a controlled interface. 
   - This helps in protecting the integrity of the data and reducing complexity.
   - **Example:** A `Car` class might encapsulate attributes like `speed` and methods like `accelerate()` and `brake()`.

2. Inheritance: 
   - Allows a new class (subclass) to inherit attributes and methods from an existing class (superclass). 
   - This promotes code reusability and establishes a hierarchical relationship between classes.
   - **Example:** A `SportsCar` class can inherit from the `Car` class, gaining its attributes and methods while adding its own features.

3. Polymorphism: 
   - Enables objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. 
   - It allows methods to be used interchangeably and can be implemented via method overriding (same method name in subclasses) or method overloading (same method name with different parameters).
   - **Example:** A method `drive()` in a superclass `Vehicle` can be overridden in subclasses `Car` and `Bike` to provide specific implementations.

4. Abstraction: 
   - Focuses on the essential characteristics of an object, ignoring irrelevant details. 
   - It defines abstract classes and interfaces that outline a set of methods without providing a complete implementation. 
   - This allows for the creation of flexible and reusable code.
   - Example: An abstract class `Shape` may define a method `draw()`, which must be implemented by any subclass like `Circle` or `Rectangle`.
