## Write Your First 'Hello World' Program in Java

- In Java, every application begins with a class name, and that class must match the filename.
- Let's create our first Java file, called Main.java, which can be done in any text editor (like Notepad).

```java
public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println("Hello World");
  }
}
```

- Save the code in Notepad as "Main.java". Open Command Prompt (cmd.exe), navigate to the directory where you saved your file, and type "javac Main.java":

```
C:\Users\`your_name`\`directory_name`>javac Main.java
```

- This will compile your code. If there are no errors in the code, the command prompt will take you to the next line. Now, type "java Main" to run the file:

```
C:\Users\`your_name`\`directory_name`>java Main
```

**Output:**
`Hello World`

Congratulations! You have written and executed your first Java program.

## Java Syntax

Lets understand the above code.

Every line of code that runs in Java must be inside a `class`. In our example, we named the class `Main`. A class should always start with an uppercase first letter.

<table style="text-align: center; border: 1px solid black; width: 100%">
	<tr>
		<td>
			NOTE <br/>
			Java is case-sensitive: "MyClass" and "myclass" has different meaning.
		</td>
	</tr>
</table>

....
