## Introduction

Polymorphism is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass.

There are two main types of polymorphism in Java:

- Compile-Time Polymorphism (Method Overloading)
- Runtime Polymorphism (Method Overriding)

## Compile-Time Polymorphism (Method Overloading)

Method overloading allows a class to have more than one method with the same name, but different parameter lists (type, number, or both).

```java
class Calculator {
  // Method to add two integers
  public int add(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
  }

  // Overloaded method to add three integers
  public int add(int a, int b, int c) {
    return a + b + c;
  }

  // Overloaded method to add two doubles
  public double add(double a, double b) {
    return a + b;
  }
}

public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Calculator calc = new Calculator();

    // Calls the method with two integers
    System.out.println("Sum of 5 and 10: " + calc.add(5, 10));

    // Calls the method with three integers
    System.out.println("Sum of 5, 10, and 15: " + calc.add(5, 10, 15));

    // Calls the method with two doubles
    System.out.println("Sum of 5.5 and 10.5: " + calc.add(5.5, 10.5));
  }
}

// Output:
// ----------
// Sum of 5 and 10: 15
// Sum of 5, 10, and 15: 30
// Sum of 5.5 and 10.5: 16.0
```

## Runtime Polymorphism (Method Overriding)

Method overriding allows a subclass to provide a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass. 
This type of polymorphism is resolved at runtime.

**Example:**
```java
// Superclass
class Animal {
  // Method to be overridden
  public void makeSound() {
    System.out.println("Some generic animal sound");
  }
}

// Subclass overriding the superclass method
class Dog extends Animal {
  @Override
  public void makeSound() {
    System.out.println("Bark");
  }
}

// Another subclass overriding the superclass method
class Cat extends Animal {
  @Override
  public void makeSound() {
    System.out.println("Meow");
  }
}

public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Animal myAnimal;

    // Reference of type Animal but object of type Dog
    myAnimal = new Dog();
    myAnimal.makeSound(); // Outputs "Bark"

    // Reference of type Animal but object of type Cat
    myAnimal = new Cat();
    myAnimal.makeSound(); // Outputs "Meow"
  }
}

// Output:
// ----------
// Bark
// Meow
```

## `@Override` Annotation

- The `@Override` annotation in Java is used to indicate that a method is intended to override a method in a superclass. 
- It provides several benefits:
  - **Compile-Time Checking:** The compiler checks if the method actually overrides a method in the superclass. If not, it will generate a compile-time error.
  - **Code Readability:** It makes the code clearer by explicitly showing that a method is meant to override a superclass method.

**Example:** Here‚Äôs how it's used:
```java
class Animal {
  public void makeSound() {
    System.out.println("Some generic animal sound");
  }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
  @Override
  public void makeSound() {
    System.out.println("Bark");
  }
}
```

## Does Java supports 'Operator Overloading & Overriding' like C++?

Java does not support **operator overloading**. This means you cannot define multiple behaviors for standard operators (like `+`, `-`, `*`, etc.) based on the operand types.

Java does not support operator overriding either. **Operator overriding** is a concept where operators behave differently in subclasses, which is not allowed in Java.

## Upcasting and Downcasting

Upcasting and downcasting are important concepts related to inheritance and polymorphism in object-oriented programming.

### Upcasting

Upcasting refers to converting a reference of a subclass type to a reference of a superclass type. It is done implicitly and safely because every instance of a subclass is also an instance of its superclass.

**Key Characteristics:**

- **Automatic and Safe:** Upcasting does not require an explicit cast and is automatically handled by Java.
- **Purpose:** Allows you to use subclass objects where a superclass reference is expected. This is useful for generalizing method arguments or return types.

**Example:**
```java
// Parent class
class Animal {
  public void sound() {
    System.out.println("Animal makes a sound");
  }
}

// Child class inheriting from Animal
class Dog extends Animal {
  @Override
  public void sound() {
    System.out.println("Dog barks");
  }

  public void fetch() {
    System.out.println("Dog fetches the ball");
  }
}

public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    // Upcasting: Child class object assigned to Parent class reference
    Animal animal = new Dog();

    // Method call using Parent class reference
    animal.sound(); // Outputs: Dog barks

    // animal.fetch(); // Compile-time error: fetch() is not in Animal class

    // Downcasting (explained below)
    if (animal instanceof Dog) {
      Dog dog = (Dog) animal;
      dog.fetch(); // Outputs: Dog fetches the ball
    }
  }
}

// Output:
// ----------
// Dog barks
// Dog fetches the ball
```

**Explanation:**
- `Animal animal = new Dog();` is upcasting where a `Dog` object is assigned to an `Animal` reference.
- The `sound()` method call on `animal` invokes `Dog` class's overridden `sound()` method due to polymorphism.
- Upcasting allows you to treat a `Dog` object as an `Animal`, leveraging the common behavior defined in `Animal`.

### Downcasting

Downcasting involves converting a reference of a superclass type back to a reference of a subclass type. This operation is explicit and can potentially throw a ClassCastException if the actual object type is not compatible with the cast.

**Key Characteristics:**

- **Explicit and Risky:** Requires an explicit cast and should be used with care to avoid runtime exceptions.
- **Purpose:** Allows access to subclass-specific methods and fields that are not available in the superclass.

**Exmaple:**
```java
class Animal {
  public void sound() {
      System.out.println("Animal makes a sound");
  }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
  @Override
  public void sound() {
      System.out.println("Dog barks");
  }
  
  public void fetch() {
      System.out.println("Dog fetches the ball");
  }
}

public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
      Animal animal = new Dog(); // Upcasting
      
      // Downcasting
      if (animal instanceof Dog) {
          Dog dog = (Dog) animal; // Explicit downcasting
          dog.fetch(); // Outputs: Dog fetches the ball
      }
  }
}

// Output: Dog fetches the ball
```

**Explanation:**
- `Animal animal = new Dog();` performs upcasting.
- `Dog dog = (Dog) animal;` explicitly downcasts `animal` to `Dog`.
- Downcasting allows you to access `Dog`-specific methods like `fetch()` that are not available in `Animal`.

### When to Use Upcasting and Downcasting
Upcasting: Use when you want to treat different objects uniformly through their common superclass interface.
Downcasting: Use when you need to access subclass-specific methods or fields that are not present in the superclass.
