## Introduction

Abstraction is a fundamental principle in object-oriented programming (OOP) that focuses on hiding the implementation details of a class while exposing a clean and simplified interface for the users of the class. It allows you to focus on what an object does rather than how it does it.

## Abstraction in Java

Abstraction in Java can be achieved through `abstract classes` and `interfaces`. These constructs allow you to define a blueprint for classes that will be implemented later, either fully or partially.

The `abstract` keyword is a non-access modifier, used for `classes` and `methods`:

## Abstract Class in Java

- An abstract class in Java is a class that cannot be instantiated on its own (i.e., you cannot create objects of an abstract class directly). 
- It serves as a base class for other classes to inherit from. 
- Abstract classes may contain abstract methods, which are methods without a body, or concrete methods (methods with a body) that can be inherited by subclasses.

**Example:**
```java
// Abstract class
abstract class Shape {
  // Abstract method (no body)
  public abstract void draw();

  // Concrete method
  public void display() {
    System.out.println("Displaying shape");
  }
}

// Concrete subclass Circle
class Circle extends Shape {
  @Override
  public void draw() {
    System.out.println("Drawing Circle");
  }
}

// Concrete subclass Rectangle
class Rectangle extends Shape {
  @Override
  public void draw() {
    System.out.println("Drawing Rectangle");
  }
}

public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Shape circle = new Circle();
    Shape rectangle = new Rectangle();

    circle.draw(); // Outputs: Drawing Circle
    circle.display(); // Outputs: Displaying shape

    rectangle.draw(); // Outputs: Drawing Rectangle
    rectangle.display(); // Outputs: Displaying shape
  }
}
```

## Combining Abstract Classes with Anonymous Inner Class concept

```java
abstract class A {
  public abstract void show();
}

public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    
    /* Following line throws an error, 
    as abstract classes cannot be instantiated or 
    we cannot create an object of abstrract classes
    */
    // A obj = new A();

    // but following code works
    A obj = new A(){
      public void show(){
        System.out.println("in A show");
      }
    };
    obj.show(); // Output: in A show
  }
}
```

**Explanation:**
- Here, `new A()` creates an anonymous inner class that extends the abstract class `A` and provides an implementation for the abstract method `show()`.
- This anonymous inner class is essentially a subclass of `A` with a concrete implementation of the `show()` method.
- `obj` is a reference of type `A` that points to this anonymous inner class instance.


## Important Questions

### 1. Can a Class be Abstract Without Having Any Abstract Methods?**

- Yes, a class can be declared abstract without having any abstract methods. 
- An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated on its own. It can be used to provide a base for subclasses to extend and share a common interface or behavior. 
- Declaring a class as abstract means that you intend for it to be used as a superclass and that it cannot be directly instantiated.

**Exampe:**
```java
abstract class Vehicle {
  // This class does not contain any abstract methods

  public void start() {
    System.out.println("Vehicle started");
  }

  public void stop() {
    System.out.println("Vehicle stopped");
  }
}

class Car extends Vehicle {
  // Inherits start() and stop() methods from Vehicle
}

public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    // Vehicle v = new Vehicle(); // This would cause a compile-time error

    Vehicle car = new Car(); // Allowed because Car is not abstract
    car.start(); // Outputs: Vehicle started
    car.stop(); // Outputs: Vehicle stopped
  }
}
```

### 2. Can a Method be Abstract, Even if Its Class is Not Abstract?
- No, a method cannot be abstract if its class is not abstract. 
- In Java, an abstract method is a method that is declared without an implementation (no method body). 
- If a class contains at least one abstract method, the class itself must be declared as abstract. 
- This is because a concrete class (non-abstract class) is expected to provide implementations for all its methods.

**Example:**
```java
abstract class Animal {
  public abstract void sound(); // Abstract method
}

class Dog extends Animal {
  @Override
  public void sound() {
    System.out.println("Bark");
  }
}

public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Animal dog = new Dog();
    dog.sound(); // Outputs: Bark
  }
}
```
