## Introduction

- Interfaces in Java allows to define methods that must be implemented by any class that chooses to implement the interface.

- Interfaces provide a way to achieve abstraction and multiple inheritance in Java. 

**Key Characteristics:**
- **Method Declarations:** 
  - Interfaces can declare methods, but they do not provide implementations for them (except for default and static methods). 
  - Classes that implement the interface must provide implementations for all abstract methods.
  - **Abstract Methods:** Interfaces primarily consist of method signatures without implementations. Implementing classes must provide concrete implementations for these methods.
  - **Default Methods:** Since Java 8, interfaces can include default methods with an implementation. This allows you to add new methods to interfaces without breaking existing implementations.
  - **Static Methods:** Interfaces can also have static methods with implementations. These methods are not inherited by implementing classes and are called on the interface itself.
- **Multiple Inheritance:** 
  - Java does not support multiple inheritance of classes but allows a class to implement multiple interfaces. 
  - This provides a way to inherit from multiple sources.
- **Implementation:** 
  - A class implements an interface using the implements keyword. 
  - The class must provide concrete implementations for all the interface's abstract methods.

**Syntax and Example:**
Defining and Interface:
```java
interface Animal {
  // Abstract method (does not have a body)
  void makeSound();

  // Default method
  default void eat() {
    System.out.println("This animal eats food.");
  }

  // Static method
  static void sleep() {
    System.out.println("Animals sleep.");
  }
}
```

Implementing the above Interface:

```java
class Dog implements Animal {
  // Providing implementation for abstract method
  @Override
  public void makeSound() {
    System.out.println("Dog barks");
  }
}

public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Dog dog = new Dog();
    dog.makeSound(); // Outputs: Dog barks
    dog.eat(); // Outputs: This animal eats food.

    Animal.sleep(); // Outputs: Animals sleep.

    Animal animal = new Dog(); // Thi is allowed
    animal.makeSound(); // Outputs: Dog barks
    animal.eat(); // Outputs: This animal eats food.
  }
}
```

**Explanation:**

- `Animal` is an interface with one abstract method `makeSound()`, one default method `eat()`, and one static method `sleep()`.
- `Dog` implements the Animal interface and provides an implementation for the `makeSound()` method.
- `eat()` can be used as provided by the interface, and `sleep()` is called statically via the interface.

## Modifiers for Interfaces 🎛️

- **Access Modifiers:**
  - `public` 🌐
    - The interface is accessible from any other class.
  - `default` (no modifier) 🏢
    - The interface is accessible only within its own package.

- **Non-Access Modifiers**:
  - `abstract` 🌀
    - Implicit for interfaces; all interfaces are abstract by definition.

<hr>
<center>
<b>💡 NOTE 💡</b>

The `abstract` keyword is redundant for interfaces because they are implicitly `abstract`. Interfaces cannot be `final`, `synchronized`, `native`, or `volatile`.
</center>

<hr/>

## Modifiers for Attributes and Methods of an Interface ⚙️

### Attributes 🎚️

- **Access Modifiers:**
  - `public` 🌐: All attributes in an interface are `public` by default.

- **Non-Access Modifiers:**
  - `static` ⚙️: Attributes in interfaces are implicitly `static`.
  - `final` 🚫: Attributes in interfaces are implicitly `final` (they are constants).

### Methods 📋

- **Access Modifiers:**
  - `public` 🌐: All methods in an interface are `public` by default.

- **Non-Access Modifiers:**
  - `abstract` 🌀: Methods are `abstract` by default unless they are `default` or `static` methods.
  - `default` 📦: Provides a default implementation for a method in an interface (starting from Java 8).
  - `static` ⚙️: Allows defining `static` methods within an interface (starting from Java 8).

**Exmaple:** The example includes an interface called `Animal`, two classes (`Dog` and `Cat`) that implement this interface, and a `Main` class to demonstrate how to use the interface.

Animal.java

```java
// Animal.java (Interface)
public interface Animal {
  // Abstract method (does not have a body)
  void makeSound();

  // Abstract method
  void eat();

  // Default method (with a body)
  default void sleep() {
    System.out.println("This animal is sleeping.");
  }
}
```

Dog.java

```java
// Dog.java (Class that implements the Animal interface)
public class Dog implements Animal {
  @Override
  public void makeSound() {
    System.out.println("The dog says: Woof woof");
  }

  @Override
  public void eat() {
    System.out.println("The dog is eating.");
  }
}

// Cat.java (Class that implements the Animal interface)
public class Cat implements Animal {
  @Override
  public void makeSound() {
    System.out.println("The cat says: Meow");
  }

  @Override
  public void eat() {
    System.out.println("The cat is eating.");
  }
}
```

Main.java

```java
// Main.java
public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    // Create objects of Dog and Cat
    Animal myDog = new Dog();
    Animal myCat = new Cat();

    // Call the methods on Dog object
    myDog.makeSound();  // Outputs: The dog says: Woof woof
    myDog.eat();        // Outputs: The dog is eating.
    myDog.sleep();      // Outputs: This animal is sleeping.

    // Call the methods on Cat object
    myCat.makeSound();  // Outputs: The cat says: Meow
    myCat.eat();        // Outputs: The cat is eating.
    myCat.sleep();      // Outputs: This animal is sleeping.
  }
}
```

Output:

```
The dog says: Woof woof
The dog is eating.
This animal is sleeping.
The cat says: Meow
The cat is eating.
This animal is sleeping.
```

## Overriding Default Method

```java
interface MyInterface {
    default void myDefaultMethod() {
        System.out.println("Default implementation");
    }
}

class MyClass implements MyInterface {
    @Override
    public void myDefaultMethod() {
        System.out.println("Overridden implementation");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyClass obj = new MyClass();
        obj.myDefaultMethod(); // Output: Overridden implementation
    }
}

```

## Types of Interfaces in Java

There are 3 types of Interfaces in java:

1. **Normal Interfaces:** with 2 or more abstract methods.

2. **Functional Interfaces (`@FunctionalInterface`):** with only 1 abstract method.

3. **Marker Interface:** with no method definition.

## Multiple Inheritance using Interfaces

**Example:**

```java
interface Animal {
  void makeSound();
}

interface Pet {
  void play();
}

class Dog implements Animal, Pet {
  @Override
  public void makeSound() {
    System.out.println("Dog barks");
  }

  @Override
  public void play() {
    System.out.println("Dog plays");
  }
}
```

### Default Methods Conflict (💎 Diamond Problem 💎)

If two interfaces that a class implements provide default methods with the same signature, the implementing class must override the method and resolve the conflict.

**Example:**
```java
interface Interface1 {
  default void show() {
    System.out.println("Interface1");
  }
}

interface Interface2 {
  default void show() {
    System.out.println("Interface2");
  }
}

class Example implements Interface1, Interface2 {
  @Override
  public void show() {
    System.out.println("Example class");
  }
}

public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Example example = new Example();
    example.show(); // Outputs: Example class
  }
}
```

## Abstract Classes vs. Interfaces

- **Abstract Classes:** 
  - Can have both abstract and concrete methods, constructors, and instance variables. 
  - A class can extend only one abstract class.
- **Interfaces:** 
  - Cannot have instance variables or constructors, only method signatures (with default or static implementations), and can be implemented by any class.

**Example:**
```java
abstract class AbstractClass {
  abstract void abstractMethod();

  void concreteMethod() {
    System.out.println("Concrete method in abstract class");
  }
}

interface Interface {
  void interfaceMethod();

  default void defaultMethod() {
    System.out.println("Default method in interface");
  }
}

class ConcreteClass extends AbstractClass implements Interface {
  @Override
  void abstractMethod() {
    System.out.println("Implemented abstract method");
  }

  @Override
  public void interfaceMethod() {
    System.out.println("Implemented interface method");
  }
}

public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    ConcreteClass obj = new ConcreteClass();
    obj.abstractMethod(); 
    // Outputs: Implemented abstract method
    obj.concreteMethod(); 
    // Outputs: Concrete method in abstract class
    obj.interfaceMethod(); 
    // Outputs: Implemented interface method
    obj.defaultMethod(); 
    // Outputs: Default method in interface
  }
}
```

## Interfaces with Fields (Constants)

Interfaces can have constants (public, static, and final fields) but cannot have instance fields.

**Example:**
```java
interface Constants {
  int MAX_VALUE = 100; // public static final by default
}

public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println(Constants.MAX_VALUE); // Outputs: 100
  }
}
```

## Inheritance in Interfaces

Interfaces can extend other interfaces, allowing for the creation of more specialized interfaces. An interface extending another interface inherits all abstract methods from the parent interface.

**1. Basic Interface Hierarchy**

**Example:**
```java
// Parent interface
interface Device {
  void powerOn();

  void powerOff();
}

// Child interface extending Device
interface SmartDevice extends Device {
  void connectToInternet();
}

// Another child interface extending SmartDevice
interface SmartHomeDevice extends SmartDevice {
  void setAlarm(String time);
}
```

**2. Implementing the Interfaces**
Implementing the above interfaces in a concrete class:

**Example:**
```java
// Parent interface
interface Device {
  void powerOn();

  void powerOff();
}

// Child interface extending Device
interface SmartDevice extends Device {
  void connectToInternet();
}

// Another child interface extending SmartDevice
interface SmartHomeDevice extends SmartDevice {
  void setAlarm(String time);
}

// Concrete class implementing the extended interfaces
class SmartLight implements SmartHomeDevice {
  @Override
  public void powerOn() {
    System.out.println("SmartLight is powered on.");
  }

  @Override
  public void powerOff() {
    System.out.println("SmartLight is powered off.");
  }

  @Override
  public void connectToInternet() {
    System.out.println("SmartLight is connected to the internet.");
  }

  @Override
  public void setAlarm(String time) {
    System.out.println("Alarm is set for " + time + " on the SmartLight.");
  }
}

public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    SmartLight smartLight = new SmartLight();

    smartLight.powerOn(); 
    // Outputs: SmartLight is powered on.
    smartLight.connectToInternet(); 
    // Outputs: SmartLight is connected to the internet.
    smartLight.setAlarm("7:00 AM"); 
    // Outputs: Alarm is set for 7:00 AM on the SmartLight.
    smartLight.powerOff(); 
    // Outputs: SmartLight is powered off.
  }
}
```

**Explanation**

- **Interface `Device`:**
  - Defines the basic contract for a device with methods to power on and off.

- **Interface `SmartDevice`:**
  - Extends `Device`, adding the capability to connect to the internet. This means any `SmartDevice` will also need to implement the methods of `Device`.

- **Interface `SmartHomeDevice`:**

  - Extends `SmartDevice`, adding a method to set an alarm. Any `SmartHomeDevice` will implement all methods from `Device`, `SmartDevice`, and its own methods.

- **Class `SmartLight`:**
  - Implements `SmartHomeDevice`, and hence, must provide implementations for all the methods declared in `Device`, `SmartDevice`, and `SmartHomeDevice`.

## Marker Interface

- A marker interface does not contain any methods or fields; it's simply an empty interface. 
- The idea is that by implementing this interface, a class signals that it belongs to a particular category or that it should be processed differently.
- The primary purpose of a marker interface is to provide metadata to the Java runtime or other components about the class that implements it. 
- This metadata can then be used to trigger specific behavior. 
- Some well-known marker interfaces in Java include:
  - `java.io.Serializable`: A class implements this interface to indicate that its objects can be serialized (converted into a byte stream).
  - `java.lang.Cloneable`: A class implements this interface to indicate that its instances can be cloned, typically via the `clone()` method.
  - `java.util.RandomAccess`: This interface is implemented by List classes that support fast (generally constant time) random access.

**Example:** 

```java
import java.io.*;

class Person implements Serializable {
    private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;
    private String name;
    private int age;

    public Person(String name, int age) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
    }

    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return "Person{name='" + name + "', age=" + age + "}";
    }
}

public class MarkerInterfaceExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Person person = new Person("John Doe", 30);

        // Serialize the object
        try (ObjectOutputStream out = new ObjectOutputStream(new FileOutputStream("person.ser"))) {
            out.writeObject(person);
            System.out.println("Person object serialized: " + person);
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }

        // Deserialize the object
        try (ObjectInputStream in = jectInputStream(new FileInputStream("person.ser"))) {
            Person deserializedPerson = (Person) in.readObject();
            System.out.println("Person object deserialized: " + deserializedPerson);
        } catch (IOException | ClassNotFoundException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

**Explanation:**
- **Serializable Interface:** The Person class implements Serializable, a marker interface, to indicate that its instances can be serialized.
- **Serialization:** In the main method, the person object is serialized (saved as a byte stream) to a file named person.ser.
- **Deserialization:** The object is then deserialized (restored from the byte stream) from the file, and the deserialized object is printed.

## Functional Interfaces

- A functional interface in Java is a type of interface that has exactly one abstract method. 
- It can have multiple default or static methods, but only one abstract method. 
- Functional interfaces are crucial in Java for supporting lambda expressions and method references, which were introduced in Java 8.

### 1. Definition and Annotation

- **Definition:**
  - A functional interface is an interface that contains exactly one abstract method. 
  - It can have multiple default methods or static methods, but it must have exactly one abstract method to qualify as a functional interface.

- **`@FunctionalInterface` Annotation:** 
  - Java provides the `@FunctionalInterface` annotation to explicitly mark an interface as a functional interface. 
  - This annotation is optional but helps enforce the constraint and provides compile-time checking.

**Example:**
```java
@FunctionalInterface
interface MyFunctionalInterface {
  // Single abstract method
  void singleAbstractMethod(); 

  // Default method (not abstract)
  default void defaultMethod() {
    System.out.println("Default method");
  }

  // Static method (not abstract)
  static void staticMethod() {
    System.out.println("Static method");
  }
}
```

### 2. Lambda Expressions

- Lambda expressions provide a concise way to implement functional interfaces. 
- They can be used wherever a functional interface is expected.

**Example:**
```java
@FunctionalInterface
interface Greeting {
  void greet(String message);
}

public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    // Using a lambda expression to implement the Greeting interface
    Greeting greeting = message -> System.out.println("Hello, " + message);

    greeting.greet("World"); // Outputs: Hello, World
  }
}
```

### 3. Method References
Method references are a shorthand notation of a lambda expression to call a method.

**Example:**
```java
@FunctionalInterface
interface Printer {
  void print(String message);
}

public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    // Method reference to an instance method
    Printer printer = System.out::println;

    printer.print("Hello, World"); // Outputs: Hello, World
  }
}
```

### Types of Functional Interfaces

## Interview Questions 🎯

### 1. What are a Interfaces? Why it was introduced❓

Interfaces in Java are abstract types that allow you to define a contract that classes can implement. They contain method declarations (without implementations) and constant variables.

Why Introduced: Interfaces were introduced to provide a way to achieve abstraction and multiple inheritance in Java. Since Java does not support multiple inheritance with classes (to avoid complexity and ambiguity), interfaces allow a class to inherit behaviors from multiple sources without the issues of multiple inheritance.

<hr>

### 2. What is a Marker interface❓

- A marker interface does not contain any methods or fields; it's simply an empty interface. 
- The idea is that by implementing this interface, a class signals that it belongs to a particular category or that it should be processed differently.
- The primary purpose of a marker interface is to provide metadata to the Java runtime or other components about the class that implements it. 
- This metadata can then be used to trigger specific behavior. 
- Some well-known marker interfaces in Java include:
  - `java.io.Serializable`: A class implements this interface to indicate that its objects can be serialized (converted into a byte stream).
  - `java.lang.Cloneable`: A class implements this interface to indicate that its instances can be cloned, typically via the `clone()` method.
  - `java.util.RandomAccess`: This interface is implemented by List classes that support fast (generally constant time) random access.

<hr>

### 3. What is Functional Interface❓

- A functional interface in Java is a type of interface that has exactly one abstract method. 
- It can have multiple default or static methods, but only one abstract method. 
- Functional interfaces are crucial in Java for supporting lambda expressions and method references, which were introduced in Java 8.

<hr>

### 4. Why are Comparable and Comparator Interfaces Required in java❓



<hr>

### 5. What are default methods? Why was it introduced❓

Default Methods are methods in an interface that have a default implementation. They were introduced in Java 8 to enable backward compatibility with older interfaces while allowing new methods to be added to interfaces without breaking existing implementations.

Why Introduced: They help provide new functionality to interfaces without forcing all implementing classes to provide their own implementation of the new methods. This makes it easier to evolve interfaces over time.

<hr>

### 6. What is `default` keyword and where it can be used❓



<hr>

### 7. Is it necessary to override default methods❓

No, it is not necessary to override default methods in an interface. Classes that implement an interface with default methods can use the provided implementation as-is. However, if a class needs a specific behavior, it can override the default method to provide its own implementation.

<hr>

### 8. How to override default methods❓

```java
interface MyInterface {
    default void myDefaultMethod() {
        System.out.println("Default implementation");
    }
}

class MyClass implements MyInterface {
    @Override
    public void myDefaultMethod() {
        System.out.println("Overridden implementation");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyClass obj = new MyClass();
        obj.myDefaultMethod(); // Output: Overridden implementation
    }
}

```

<hr>

### 9. Are static methods available to implementing classes by default❓

No, static methods in an interface are not inherited by implementing classes. They belong to the interface itself, not to instances of the implementing class. To call a static method of an interface, you need to use the interface's name.

```java
interface MyInterface {
    static void myStaticMethod() {
        System.out.println("Static method in interface");
    }
}

class MyClass implements MyInterface {
    // No need to override static methods
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyInterface.myStaticMethod(); // Output: Static method in interface
    }
}

```
