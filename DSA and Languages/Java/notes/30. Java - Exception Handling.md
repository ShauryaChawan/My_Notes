## Introduction

- Exception handling in Java is a mechanism used to manage runtime errors, known as exceptions, that occur during the execution of a program. 
- It allows developers to gracefully handle unexpected situations and ensure the robustness of their applications. 

## Types of Exceptions

- **Checked Exceptions:** 
  - These are exceptions that are checked at compile-time. 
  - These exceptions are subclasses of `Exception` but not subclasses of `RuntimeException`.
- **Unchecked Exceptions (Runtime Exceptions):** 
  - These are exceptions that occur at runtime and are subclasses of `RuntimeException`. 
  - They typically indicate programming errors such as division by zero, null pointer dereference, etc.
- **Errors:** 
  - These are exceptional situations that are typically caused by the environment in which the application is running. 
  - Examples include `OutOfMemoryError`, `StackOverflowError`, etc.

## Exception Handling Keywords and Constructs

### `try-catch` Block:

- The try-catch block is used to handle exceptions. 
- Code that might throw an exception is placed inside the try block, and the corresponding catch blocks handle the exceptions if they occur.

**Syntax and Example:**
```java
try {
    // Code that might throw an exception
} catch (ExceptionType1 e1) {
    // Handle exception of type ExceptionType1
} catch (ExceptionType2 e2) {
    // Handle exception of type ExceptionType2
} finally {
    // Optional block executed after try/catch regardless of whether an exception occurred or not
}
```

### `throw` keyword:

- The `throw` keyword is used to explicitly throw an exception. It is followed by an instance of `Throwable` (usually an exception object) that indicates the type of exception being thrown.

**Example:**
```java
throw new Exception("Something went wrong");
```

- The `throws` keyword is used in method signatures to declare that a method may throw one or more exceptions. It informs the caller of the method about the exceptions that need to be handled.

**Example:**
```java
public void someMethod() throws IOException, SQLException {
    // Method code that might throw IOException or SQLException
}
```

### `finally` keyword:

The finally block is used to execute important code such as closing resources (like files, sockets, etc.) whether an exception is thrown or not.

**Syntax and Example:**
```java
try {
    // Code that might throw an exception
} catch (Exception e) {
    // Handle exception
} finally {
    // Code that will always execute, regardless of whether an exception occurred or not
}
```
OR
```java
try {
    // Code that might throw an exception
} finally {
    // Code that will always execute, regardless of whether an exception occurred or not
}
```
## Real Life Example

```java
import java.io.File;
import java.io.FileNotFoundException;
import java.util.Scanner;

public class FileHandlingExample {

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    // Replace with the path to an existing file on your system
    String filePath = "path/to/your/file.txt";

    try {
      readFileContents(filePath);
    } catch (FileNotFoundException e) {
      System.err.println("File not found: " + e.getMessage());
      // Optionally, handle the exception or rethrow it
    } catch (Exception e) {
      System.err.println("Exception occurred: " + e.getMessage());
    } finally {
      System.out.println("Executing finally block.");
      // Close any resources here, if needed
    }

    System.out.println("End of program.");
  }

  public static void readFileContents(String filePath) throws FileNotFoundException {
    File file = new File(filePath);
    Scanner scanner = new Scanner(file);

    try {
      // Read file contents line by line
      while (scanner.hasNextLine()) {
        String line = scanner.nextLine();
        System.out.println(line);
      }
    } finally {
      // Close the scanner in the finally block to ensure it gets closed
      if (scanner != null) {
        scanner.close();
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Best Practices in Exception Handling

- **Catch Specific Exceptions:**
  - Handle specific exceptions rather than catching `Exception` to avoid masking other potential issues.
- **Clean Up Resources in `finally`:**
  - Use finally for resource cleanup (closing files, database connections) to ensure resources are released even if an exception occurs.
- **Logging Exceptions:**
  - Log exceptions with sufficient information (message, stack trace) to aid debugging.
- **Use Custom Exceptions:**
  - Define custom exception classes for specific application-level errors to provide meaningful error messages and context.
- **Avoid Swallowing Exceptions:**
  - Avoid scenarios where exceptions are caught but not handled appropriately. 
  - Consider logging or rethrowing the exception if it cannot be handled locally.

## Custom Exception

```java
// Custom Exception class
class InvalidAgeException extends Exception {
  public InvalidAgeException(String message) {
    super(message);
  }
}

// Example class that uses the custom exception
class Voter {
  private String name;
  private int age;

  public Voter(String name, int age) throws InvalidAgeException {
    this.name = name;

    if (age < 18) {
      throw new InvalidAgeException("Invalid age for voting: " + age);
    }

    this.age = age;
  }

  public void castVote() {
    System.out.println(name + " has cast the vote.");
  }
}

// Main class to demonstrate custom exception usage
public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    try {
      Voter voter1 = new Voter("Alice", 20);
      voter1.castVote(); // Outputs: Alice has cast the vote.

      Voter voter2 = new Voter("Bob", 16); // This will throw InvalidAgeException
      voter2.castVote(); // This line won't execute due to exception
    } catch (InvalidAgeException e) {
      System.out.println("Exception caught: " + e.getMessage());
      // Handle the exception or provide feedback to the user
    }
  }
}
```
