## Introduction

- Java Garbage Collection (GC) is a crucial aspect of memory management in the Java programming language.
- It automatically handles the reclamation of memory that is no longer in use, freeing up resources and preventing memory leaks.
- It is designed to efficiently manage the heap memory.

## How can an object be unreferenced?

There are many ways, but the most common ways are:
1. By nulling the reference
2. By assigning a reference to another
3. By anonymous object etc.

**Example:** By nulling a reference:

```java
Employee e=new Employee();  
e=null;  
```

**Example:** By assigning a reference to another:

```java
Employee e1=new Employee();  
Employee e2=new Employee();  
e1=e2;

//now the first object referred by e1 is available for garbage collection  
```

**Example:** By anonymous object:

```java
new Employee();  
```

## How Garbage Collection Works

1. **Object Creation and Reachability:**

   - Objects are created on the heap memory. 
   - An object is considered "reachable" if it can be accessed directly or indirectly from the roots (e.g., static fields, local variables, etc.).

2. **Mark-and-Sweep Algorithm:**

   - **Mark Phase:** The GC identifies which objects are still reachable from the root.
   - **Sweep Phase:** The GC reclaims the memory used by objects that are not marked as reachable.

3. **Generational Garbage Collection:**

   - **Young Generation:** 
     - **Purpose:**
       - This area is where new objects are allocated.
       - Since many objects are short-lived, they are typically collected quickly in this region.
     - **Structure:** It consists of the Eden Space and two Survivor Spaces (S0 and S1).
       - **Eden Space:** The area where new objects are initially created. Most objects are created here.
       - **Survivor Spaces (S0 and S1):** After a minor garbage collection (GC), objects that are still alive are moved from the Eden Space to one of the Survivor Spaces. Objects are moved between these two spaces (S0 and S1) during subsequent minor GCs.
     - **Garbage Collection:** A minor GC occurs frequently in the Young Generation. Objects that survive multiple GC cycles are eventually moved to the Old Generation.
   - **Old Generation (Tenured Generation):** 
     - **Purpose:** This region stores objects that have survived several minor GCs in the Young Generation. These objects are considered long-lived.
     - **Garbage Collection:** Major GC (or full GC) is performed less frequently in the Old Generation. It is more costly in terms of time and resources because it involves the entire heap rather than just the Young Generation.
   - **Permanent Generation (Metaspace in JDK 8+):** 
     - **Purpose:** This area is responsible for storing metadata about classes and methods, including the bytecode, names, and method data. Before JDK 8, this was known as the Permanent Generation.
     - **Metaspace (JDK 8+):**
       - In JDK 8 and later, the Permanent Generation was replaced with Metaspace, which is allocated in native memory rather than the heap. 
       - This change allowed for more flexible memory management, reducing the risk of OutOfMemoryError for metadata.
     - **Garbage Collection:** The Metaspace or Permanent Generation is cleaned up when classes and methods are unloaded.

## Types of Garbage Collectors

1. **Serial Garbage Collector:**

   - Designed for single-threaded environments.
   - Example: Use the -XX:+UseSerialGC option.

2. **Parallel Garbage Collector:**

   - Uses multiple threads for garbage collection, suitable for multi-threaded applications.
   - Example: Use the -XX:+UseParallelGC option.

3. **Concurrent Mark-Sweep (CMS) Garbage Collector:**

- Aims to minimize pauses by doing most of the work concurrently with the application threads.
- Example: Use the -XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC option.

4. **G1 Garbage Collector:**

- Aims to provide high throughput and low pause times by dividing the heap into regions.
- Example: Use the -XX:+UseG1GC option.

## Automatic GC Examples and Code Explanation

### Example 1: Basic Garbage Collection

```java
public class GCExample {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
      // Creating objects
    for (int i = 0; i < 10000; i++) {
      Object obj = new Object();
      if (i % 1000 == 0) {
        System.gc(); // Request garbage collection
        System.out.println("Garbage collection requested.");
      }
    }
    System.out.println("End of program.");
  }
}
```

Output:

```
Garbage collection requested.
Garbage collection requested.
...
End of program.
```

**Explanation:**

- **Object Creation:** Creates a large number of objects in a loop.
- **GC Request:** Calls `System.gc()` to suggest that the JVM performs garbage collection.
- **Output:** The actual GC behavior might not be observed as `System.gc()` is only a hint to the JVM.

### Example 2: Generational Garbage Collection

```java
public class GenerationalGC {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
      // Allocate objects
    for (int i = 0; i < 10000; i++) {
      allocateObject();
      if (i % 1000 == 0) {
        System.out.println("Iteration: " + i);
      }
    }
  }

  private static void allocateObject() {
    // Create objects in a method
    Object obj = new Object();
  }
}
```

Outpuut:

```
Iteration: 0
Iteration: 1000
...
```

**Explanation:**

- **Object Allocation:** Creates objects repeatedly, which will mostly be allocated in the Young Generation.
- **GC Behavior:** As the heap fills, the GC will perform minor collections to clean up the Young Generation and promote objects to the Old Generation.

## The `finalize()`

**Purpose:**
- The `finalize()` method in Java is part of the Object class and is used to perform cleanup actions on an object before it is reclaimed by the garbage collector. 
- This method is called by the garbage collector when it determines that there are no more references to the object.

**Usage:**
- **Resource Cleanup:** Typically used to release resources like file handles, network connections, or database connections.
- **Automatic Invocation:** finalize() is called automatically by the garbage collector; you do not call it directly.

**Key Points:**

- **Not a Destructor:** 
  - Java does not have destructors like C++. 
  - The `finalize()` method provides a similar capability but in a more controlled and less reliable manner.
- **Override:** 
  - Developers can override the `finalize()` method in their classes to perform cleanup activities, such as closing files or releasing non-memory resources (e.g., sockets or database connections).
- **Not Guaranteed to Run:** 
  - The execution of `finalize()` is not guaranteed. 
  - The garbage collector might not get to all objects, and therefore some objects' `finalize()` methods might never be called.
- **Performance Impact:** 
  - Relying on `finalize()` can lead to performance issues. 
  - Objects with a `finalize()` method take longer to be garbage collected because the garbage collector needs to perform additional work.
- **Deprecation:** 
  - Starting with Java 9, the `finalize()` method has been deprecated due to its unpredictability and the availability of better alternatives (like `try-with-resources` and explicit resource management). 
  - It is recommended to avoid using `finalize()`.
  - **Official Reason:** The finalization mechanism is inherently problematic. Finalization can lead to performance issues, deadlocks, and hangs. Errors in finalizers can lead to resource leaks; there is no way to cancel finalization if it is no longer necessary; and no ordering is specified among calls to finalize methods of different objects. Furthermore, there are no guarantees regarding the timing of finalization. The finalize method might be called on a finalizable object only after an indefinite delay, if at all. Classes whose instances hold non-heap resources should provide a method to enable explicit release of those resources, and they should also implement `AutoCloseable` if appropriate. The `Cleaner` and `PhantomReference` provide more flexible and efficient ways to release resources when an object becomes unreachable.

**Syntax:**

```java
protected void finalize() throws Throwable {
  // Cleanup code
  super.finalize(); // Call to the superclass's finalize method
}
```

**Example:**

```java
public class FinalizeExample {
  private String resourceName;

  public FinalizeExample(String resourceName) {
    this.resourceName = resourceName;
  }

  @Override
  protected void finalize() throws Throwable {
    try {
      System.out.println("Cleaning up resources for: " + resourceName);
      // Simulate resource cleanup
    } finally {
      super.finalize(); // Ensure the superclass's finalize method is also called
    }
  }

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    FinalizeExample obj1 = new FinalizeExample("Resource1");
    FinalizeExample obj2 = new FinalizeExample("Resource2");

    obj1 = null;
    obj2 = null;

    // Suggest garbage collection
    System.gc();

    try {
      // Wait a bit for the garbage collector to do its work
      Thread.sleep(1000);
    } catch (InterruptedException e) {
      e.printStackTrace();
    }

    System.out.println("End of program.");
  }
}
```

**Explanation:**

- **Object Creation:** Two objects are created with resources.
- **Resource Cleanup:** `finalize()` method is overridden to print a message indicating resource cleanup.
- **Garbage Collection:** The `System.gc()` method suggests that the garbage collector run, but it‚Äôs not guaranteed to do so immediately.
- **Output:** You might see messages indicating resource cleanup if the garbage collector decides to run.


Output:

```
Cleaning up resources for: Resource1
Cleaning up resources for: Resource2
End of program.
```

## The `gc()` Method

**Purpose:**

- The `gc()` method is a static method of the `System` and `Runtime` classes. 
- It suggests to the JVM that it would be a good time to run the garbage collector. 
- However, calling `gc()` does not guarantee that the garbage collection will actually occur immediately, or even at all.

**Key Points:**

- **Request, Not a Command:** 
  - Calling `gc()` is only a request to the JVM to run the garbage collector. 
  - The JVM decides whether to honor this request based on its own optimization and memory management strategies.
- **Explicit Invocation:** 
  - Although Java manages memory automatically, you might want to suggest garbage collection in scenarios where you know a significant amount of memory has been freed and you wish to reclaim it.
- **Performance Considerations:**  
  - Overusing `gc()` can lead to performance degradation because frequent garbage collection can cause application pauses. 
  - It's generally better to let the JVM handle garbage collection autonomously.
- **Typical Use Case:** 
  - A common scenario for using `gc()` might be after a large object or many objects that are no longer needed, and you want to suggest that the memory to be reclaimed.

**Syntax:**
```java
System.gc();
```
OR
```java
Runtime.getRuntime().gc();
```

**Example:** Using `System.gc()`

```java
public class GCDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Creating an object of GCDemo class
        GCDemo demo = new GCDemo();

        // Setting the object reference to null, making it eligible for garbage collection
        demo = null;

        // Suggesting the JVM to perform garbage collection
        System.gc();

        // Printing a message
        System.out.println("System.gc() was called!");
    }

    // Overriding the finalize() method
    @Override
    protected void finalize() throws Throwable {
        System.out.println("GCDemo object is being garbage collected!");
    }
}
```

**Explanation:**

- In this example, the `System.gc()` method is called to suggest garbage collection after setting the `demo` object to `null`. 
- If the garbage collector decides to run, it will call the overridden `finalize()` method of the `GCDemo` object before reclaiming its memory.

**Exmaple:** Using `Runtime.getRuntime().gc()`

```java
public class GCDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Creating an object of GCDemo class
        GCDemo demo = new GCDemo();

        // Setting the object reference to null, making it eligible for garbage collection
        demo = null;

        // Getting the runtime instance and suggesting garbage collection
        Runtime.getRuntime().gc();

        // Printing a message
        System.out.println("Runtime.getRuntime().gc() was called!");
    }

    // Overriding the finalize() method
    @Override
    protected void finalize() throws Throwable {
        System.out.println("GCDemo object is being garbage collected!");
    }
}
```

## Alternatives the `finalize()`

### 1. `try-with-resources` Statement (since Java 7)

- This is the preferred way to manage resources like files, sockets, and database connections that need to be closed after use.
- It automatically closes the resource when the block exits, whether due to normal completion or an exception.

- **Automatic Resource Management:** Resources that implement `AutoCloseable` (or `java.io.Closeable` for I/O resources) are automatically closed at the end of the `try` block, regardless of whether the block completes normally or due to an exception.

- **Simplified Syntax:** It simplifies resource management by eliminating the need for explicit `finally` blocks to close resources.

- **Multiple Resources:** You can manage multiple resources in a single `try-with-resources` statement by separating them with semicolons.

- **Exception Handling:** If both the `try` block and the `close()` method of the resources throw exceptions, the exceptions from `close()` will be suppressed and available via the `addSuppressed()` method of the primary exception.

- **Resource Declaration:** Resources are declared within the parentheses of the try statement, and their scope is limited to the try block.

```java
try (FileInputStream fileInputStream = new FileInputStream("file.txt")) {
    // Use the fileInputStream
} catch (IOException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
}
// fileInputStream is automatically closed here
```

### 2. Explicit Resource Management

- Manually managing resources using try-finally blocks to ensure that resources are released properly.

```java
FileInputStream fileInputStream = null;
try {
    fileInputStream = new FileInputStream("file.txt");
    // Use the fileInputStream
} catch (IOException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
} finally {
    if (fileInputStream != null) {
        try {
            fileInputStream.close();
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}

```

### 3. Using `Cleaner` (Java 9) or `PhantomReference` (Java 1.2)

- For more advanced cases where you need to manage non-memory resources that require cleanup, Java provides the `Cleaner` class (since Java 9) or `PhantomReference`.

```java
class Resource implements AutoCloseable {
    private static final Cleaner cleaner = Cleaner.create();
    private final Cleaner.Cleanable cleanable;

    public Resource() {
        cleanable = cleaner.register(this, this::cleanup);
    }

    private void cleanup() {
        System.out.println("Cleaning up resources...");
    }

    @Override
    public void close() {
        cleanable.clean();
    }
}

public class CleanerDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try (Resource resource = new Resource()) {
            // Use the resource
        }
    }
}
```

## Interview Questions üéØ

### 1. What is garbage collection in Java, and why is it important‚ùì

Garbage collection is the process by which the JVM automatically reclaims memory by removing objects that are no longer reachable in the program. It is important because it helps manage memory efficiently, preventing memory leaks and reducing the need for manual memory management.

<hr>

### 2. How does the Java garbage collector determine when to reclaim memory‚ùì

The garbage collector reclaims memory when it identifies that an object is no longer reachable from any live thread or static references, meaning no part of the program can access it.

<hr>

### 3. What are some common garbage collection algorithms used in the JVM‚ùì

- **Serial GC:** Uses a single thread for garbage collection.
- **Parallel GC:** Uses multiple threads to speed up the GC process.
- **G1 GC:** Divides the heap into regions and prioritizes garbage collection in regions with the most garbage.
- **ZGC:** Aims for very low pause times by collecting garbage concurrently with application threads.

<hr>

### 4. What happens if the JVM runs out of memory, and how can you prevent this‚ùì

If the JVM runs out of memory, it throws an `OutOfMemoryError`. Prevention strategies include optimizing memory usage, tuning the heap size, and avoiding memory leaks by properly managing object references.

<hr>

### 5. Can you explain the difference between strong, weak, soft, and phantom references in Java‚ùì

- **Strong Reference:** Prevents an object from being garbage collected.
- **Weak Reference:** The object is collected if no strong references exist.
- **Soft Reference:** The object is collected only if the JVM is low on memory.
- **Phantom Reference:** The object is enqueued after the finalization process but before memory is reclaimed.

<hr>


### 6. What is the `finalize()` method in Java, and what was its intended use‚ùì

The `finalize()` method was intended for cleanup before an object is garbage collected. It is called by the GC on an object when it determines that there are no more references to the object.

<hr>

### 7. Why has the `finalize()` method been deprecated, and what issues does it present‚ùì

- Starting with Java 9, the `finalize()` method has been deprecated due to its unpredictability and the availability of better alternatives (like `try-with-resources` and explicit resource management). 
- It is recommended to avoid using `finalize()`.
- **Offical Reason:** 
  - The finalization mechanism is inherently problematic. 
  - Finalization can lead to performance issues, deadlocks, and hangs. 
  - Errors in finalizers can lead to resource leaks; there is no way to cancel finalization if it is no longer necessary; and no ordering is specified among calls to finalize methods of different objects. 
  - Furthermore, there are no guarantees regarding the timing of finalization. 
  - The finalize method might be called on a finalizable object only after an indefinite delay, if at all. 
  - Classes whose instances hold non-heap resources should provide a method to enable explicit release of those resources, and they should also implement `AutoCloseable` if appropriate. 
  - The `Cleaner` and `PhantomReference` classes provide more flexible and efficient ways to release resources when an object becomes unreachable.

<hr>

### 8. Can you give an example of how `finalize()` was typically used‚ùì

```java
@Override
protected void finalize() throws Throwable {
    System.out.println("Object is being garbage collected!");
}
```

<hr>

### 9. What are the risks of relying on `finalize()` for resource cleanup‚ùì

Same as Q7

<hr>

### 10. What alternatives exist for resource cleanup in modern Java programming instead of using `finalize()`‚ùì

Alternatives include `try-with-resources`, `try-finally` blocks, and the `Cleaner` class.

<hr>


### 11. What does the `System.gc()` method do in Java‚ùì

`System.gc()` is a suggestion to the JVM to run the garbage collector, but it doesn't guarantee that GC will be invoked immediately or at all.

<hr>

### 12. Does calling `System.gc()` or `Runtime.getRuntime().gc()` guarantee immediate garbage collection? Why or why not‚ùì

No, it‚Äôs just a request to the JVM, and the JVM may ignore it based on its own internal optimizations.

<hr>

### 13. In what scenarios might you consider calling `System.gc()` explicitly, and what are the potential downsides‚ùì

You might call `System.gc()` after freeing up a significant amount of memory, but it can lead to performance issues due to potential GC pauses.

GC pauses (Garbage Collection pauses) refer to the periods during which the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) temporarily suspends the execution of application threads to perform garbage collection tasks. During these pauses, the JVM stops the normal operation of the application to reclaim memory by identifying and removing unreachable objects from the heap.

<hr>

### 14. How does the JVM decide whether to honor a `gc()` request‚ùì

The JVM decides based on internal heuristics, current memory usage, and optimization strategies.

Interval heuristics in the context of the JVM refer to the strategies and algorithms used by the JVM to determine the optimal times to perform certain actions, such as garbage collection. The JVM uses these heuristics to balance application performance with memory management, aiming to minimize disruptions (like GC pauses) while efficiently reclaiming memory.

<hr>

### 15. Can you describe a situation where frequent calls to `gc(`) might lead to performance problems‚ùì

Frequent calls can cause excessive GC pauses, leading to decreased application performance, especially in environments with high memory allocation.

<hr>


### 16. What is the `try-with-resources` statement, and how does it work in Java‚ùì

`try-with-resources` is a statement that automatically closes resources (like files or streams) when the block is exited, ensuring proper resource management.


- **Automatic Resource Management:** Resources that implement `AutoCloseable` (or `java.io.Closeable` for I/O resources) are automatically closed at the end of the `try` block, regardless of whether the block completes normally or due to an exception.

- **Simplified Syntax:** It simplifies resource management by eliminating the need for explicit `finally` blocks to close resources.

- **Multiple Resources:** You can manage multiple resources in a single `try-with-resources` statement by separating them with semicolons.

- **Exception Handling:** If both the `try` block and the `close()` method of the resources throw exceptions, the exceptions from `close()` will be suppressed and available via the `addSuppressed()` method of the primary exception.

- **Resource Declaration:** Resources are declared within the parentheses of the try statement, and their scope is limited to the try block.

```java
try (BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file.txt"))) {
    // Use the reader
} catch (IOException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
}
```

<hr>

### 17. How does the `try-with-resources` statement help with resource management in Java‚ùì

It ensures that resources are automatically closed when no longer needed, even if an exception occurs, preventing resource leaks.

<hr>

### 18. What is the `Cleaner` class in Java, and how does it differ from `finalize()`‚ùì

`Cleaner` is a more reliable mechanism for cleaning up resources. Unlike `finalize()`, it allows explicit registration of cleanup actions without relying on the GC's timing.

<hr>

### 19. Can you explain how `PhantomReference` can be used for resource cleanup‚ùì

`PhantomReference` allows you to perform actions after an object is no longer reachable but before its memory is reclaimed, typically used for post-mortem cleanup tasks.

<hr>

### 20. Why is explicit resource management preferred over relying on the garbage collector‚ùì

Explicit resource management is deterministic and predictable, ensuring that resources are released as soon as they are no longer needed, rather than waiting for the garbage collector to run.

### 23. How does Java's garbage collection handle large objects or long-lived objects‚ùì

Large objects are usually allocated directly in the old generation, while long-lived objects are promoted from the young generation to the old generation as they survive multiple GC cycles.
