## Variables

Variables are containers for storing data values.

### Declaring (Creating) Variables

To create a variable, you must specify the type and assign it a value:

```
type variableName = value;
```

### Print Variables 

The `println()` method is often used to display variables.
To combine both text and a variable, use the `+` character:

```java
String name = "John";
System.out.println("Hello " + name);
```
**Output**:
`Hello John`

For numeric values, the `+` character works as a mathematical operator (notice that we use int (integer) variables here):

```java
int x = 5;
int y = 6;
System.out.println(x + y); // Print the value of x + y
```

### Declare Many Variables

To declare more than one variable of the same type, you can use a comma-separated list:

```java
int x = 5;
int y = 6;
int z = 50;
System.out.println(x + y + z);
```

OR

```java
int x = 5, y = 6, z = 50;
System.out.println(x + y + z);
```

### One Value to Multiple Variables

You can also assign the same value to multiple variables in one line:

```java
int x, y, z;
x = y = z = 50;
System.out.println(x + y + z);
```

## Identifiers

The general rules for naming variables are:

- Names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs
- Names must begin with a letter or with $ and _.
- Names should start with a lowercase letter, and cannot contain whitespace.
- Names are case-sensitive ("myVar" and "myvar" are different variables).
- Reserved words (like Java keywords, such as int or boolean) cannot be used as names.

## Real Life Example

Program to store:
```java
// Student data
String studentName = "John Doe";
int studentID = 15;
int studentAge = 23;
float studentFee = 75.25f;
char studentGrade = 'B';

// Print variables
System.out.println("Student name: " + studentName);
System.out.println("Student id: " + studentID);
System.out.println("Student age: " + studentAge);
System.out.println("Student fee: " + studentFee);
System.out.println("Student grade: " + studentGrade);
```

Calculate area of rectangle:

```java
// Create integer variables
int length = 4;
int width = 6;
int area;

// Calculate the area of a rectangle
area = length * width;

// Print variables
System.out.println("Length is: " + length);
System.out.println("Width is: " + width);
System.out.println("Area of the rectangle is: " + area);
```

## Data types

Data types are divided into two groups:

- Primitive data types - includes `byte`, `short`, `int`, `long`, `float`, `double`, `boolean` and `char`
- Non-primitive data types - such as `String`, `Arrays` and `Classes`.

```java
int numl = 9
byte by = 127
short sh = 558
long l = 58541;
float f = 5.8f;
double d = 5.8;
char c = '8'
boolean b = true;
```

## Numbers

- **Integer** types stores whole numbers, positive or negative (such as 123 or -456), without decimals. Valid types are `byte`, `short`, `int` and `long`. 

- **Floating Point** types represents numbers with a fractional part, containing one or more decimals. There are two types: `float` and `double`.

### Byte `byte`

- Size: 1 byte
- Description: Stores whole numbers from -128 to 127
- Example:
```java
byte num1 = 100;
System.out.println(num1); // output: 100
```

### Short `short`
- Size: 2 bytes
- Description: Stores whole numbers from -32,768 to 32,767
- Example:
```java
short myNum = 5000;
System.out.println(myNum); // output: 5000
```

### Integer `int`

- Size: 4 bytes
- Description: Stores whole numbers from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647
- Example:
```java
int myNum = 100000;
System.out.println(myNum);
```

### Long `long`

- Size: 8 bytes
- Description: Stores whole numbers from -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807. Use 'L' or 'l' to denote a `long`.
- Example:
```java
long myNum = 15000000000L;
System.out.println(myNum);
```
### Float `float`

- Size: 4 bytes
- Description: Stores fractional numbers. Sufficient for storing 6 to 7 decimal digits. Use 'f' or 'F' to denote a `float` or else it would be treated as `double`, as `double` is default for floating point numbers in java.
- Example:
```java
float myNum = 5.75f;
System.out.println(myNum);
```

### Double `double`

- Size: 8 bytes
- Description: Stores fractional numbers. Sufficient for storing 15 decimal digits. Use 'd' or 'D' to denote a `double` or else it would be treated as `double`, as `double` is default for floating point numbers in java
- Example:
```java
double myNum = 19.99d;
System.out.println(myNum);
```

### Example on Number
```java
// decimal  (base 10)
int i = 9; 
System.out.println(i); // output: 9

//binary (base 2)
int ib = 0b101;
System.out.println(ib); // output: 5

//octa-decimal (base 8)
int io = 012;
System.out.println(io); // output: 10

//hexa-decimal (base 16)
int ih = 0x7E;
System.out.println(ih); // output: 5

//use '_' to represnt large number,
// just for human to read number conviently
int ibig = 10_00_00_000;
System.out.println(ibig); // output: 100000000

// big numbers
double d = 12e10;
System.out.println(d); // output: 1.2E11

```

## Booleans

- Size: 1 bit
- Description: Stores `true` or `false` values
- Example:
```java
boolean isJavaFun = true;
boolean isFishTasty = false;
System.out.println(isJavaFun);     // Outputs true
System.out.println(isFishTasty);   // Outputs false
```

## Characters

- Size: 2 bytes
- Description: Stores a single character/letter or ASCII values
- Example:
```java
// Example 1
char myGrade = 'B';
System.out.println(myGrade);

// Example 2:
char myVar1 = 65, myVar2 = 66, myVar3 = 67;
System.out.println(myVar1); // Output: A
System.out.println(myVar2); // Output: B
System.out.println(myVar3); // Output: C
```

## Interview Questions üéØ

### 1. Why Java is not 100% Object-oriented‚ùì

Java is often considered not 100% object-oriented due to the following reasons:

- **Primitive Data Types:** 
  - Java includes primitive types (`byte`, `short`, `int`, `long`, float, double, char, boolean) that are not objects. 
  - While primitives provide performance benefits and are used for basic data manipulation, they break the pure object-oriented paradigm where everything should be an object.

- **Static Methods and Variables:** 
  - Java allows static methods and variables, which belong to a class rather than instances of the class. 
  - This is not aligned with the object-oriented principle of encapsulating behavior within objects.

- **Primitive Type Wrappers:** 
  - Although Java provides wrapper classes (e.g., `Integer`, `Double`, etc.) to handle primitives as objects, the language itself still operates with primitives at a fundamental level.

In summary, Java incorporates both object-oriented and non-object-oriented features to balance performance and flexibility with the principles of object-oriented programming.

### 2. How to get type of a primitive datatype‚ùì

In Java, determining the type of a primitive data type directly isn't as straightforward as with objects because primitives don't have methods or associated classes that provide this information. However, you can work with the corresponding wrapper classes to determine the type.

### 3. How to get type of a non-primitive datatype‚ùì

In Java, you can determine the type of a non-primitive data type (i.e., objects) using the `getClass()` method, which is available for all objects since every class in Java inherits from the `Object` class. 

```java
public class NonPrimitiveTypeCheck {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String stringValue = "Hello, World!";
        Integer integerValue = 42;
        Double doubleValue = 3.14;

        checkType(stringValue);
        checkType(integerValue);
        checkType(doubleValue);
    }

    public static void checkType(Object obj) {
        System.out.println("Type: " + obj.getClass().getName());
    }
}
```

- **`getClass()` Method:** The `getClass()` method returns the runtime class of the object. It's a method inherited from the `Object` class, so it's available to every object in Java.
 
- **`getName()` Method:** The `getName()` method, when called on the `Class` object returned by `getClass()`, returns the fully qualified name of the class (i.e., the package name followed by the class name).
