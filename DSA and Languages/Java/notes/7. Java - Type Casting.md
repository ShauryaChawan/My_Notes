<h1 style="text-align: center">7. Java Type Casting</h1>

## Type Casting in Java (Intro)

Type casting is when you assign a value of one primitive data type to another type.

In Java, there are two types of casting:

Widening Casting (automatically) - converting a smaller type to a larger type size
`byte` -> `short` -> `char` -> `int` -> `long` -> `float` -> `double`

Narrowing Casting (manually) - converting a larger type to a smaller size type
`double` -> `float` -> `long` -> `int` -> `char` -> `short` -> `byte`

## Widening Casting

Widening casting is done automatically when passing a smaller size type to a larger size type:

```java
public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    int myInt = 9;
		
		// Automatic casting: int to double
    double myDouble = myInt; 

    System.out.println(myInt);      
		// Outputs 9
    
		System.out.println(myDouble);  
		// Outputs 9.0
  }
}
```

## Narrow Casting

Narrowing casting must be done manually by placing the type in parentheses `()` in front of the value:

```java
public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    double myDouble = 9.78d;
		
		// Manual casting: double to int
    int myInt = (int) myDouble; 

    System.out.println(myDouble);   
		// Outputs 9.78
    
		System.out.println(myInt);      
		// Outputs 9
  }
}
```

**Real Life Example:** create a program to calculate the percentage of a user's score in relation to the maximum score in a game.
We use type casting to make sure that the result is a floating-point value, rather than an integer:

```java
// Set the maximum possible score in the game to 500
int maxScore = 500;

// The actual score of the user
int userScore = 423;

/* Calculate the percantage of the user's score in relation to the maximum available score.
Convert userScore to float to make sure that the division is accurate */
float percentage = (float) userScore / maxScore * 100.0f;

System.out.println("User's percentage is " + percentage);
```

## Type Promotion

- Type promotion in Java refers to the automatic conversion of a smaller data type to a larger data type when an operation involves both types. 
- This happens to prevent data loss. 
- Type promotion is important in arithmetic operations, where Java ensures that the result is of a type large enough to hold the values involved.

**Rules of Type Promotion**
- `byte`, `short`, and `char` types are promoted to `int` when involved in an arithmetic operation.
- `int` is promoted to `long` when combined with `long`.
- `float` is promoted to `double` when combined with `double`.
- `char` is promoted to `int`.

**Example:**
```java
byte byteVal = 10;
short shortVal = 20;
int intVal = 30;
long longVal = 40L;
float floatVal = 50.5f;
double doubleVal = 60.5;

// byte, short, or char promoted to int
int result = byteVal * byteVal * byteVal; // byte and short promoted to int
System.out.println("Result of byte * byte * byte: " + result);

// byte, short, and char promoted to int
int result1 = byteVal + shortVal; // byte and short promoted to int
System.out.println("Result of byte + short: " + result1);

// int promoted to long
long result2 = intVal + longVal; // int promoted to long
System.out.println("Result of int + long: " + result2);

// float promoted to double
double result3 = floatVal + doubleVal; // float promoted to double
System.out.println("Result of float + double: " + result3);

// Combining int and double, int promoted to double
double result4 = intVal + doubleVal;
System.out.println("Result of int + double: " + result4);

// Explicit casting to demonstrate narrowing conversion
int result5 = (int) (floatVal + doubleVal); // float and double promoted to double, then cast to int
System.out.println("Result of casting (float + double) to int: " + result5);
```
