```
mkdir hello-world
cd hello-world
```

2. **Initialize the project (optional):** Run the following command to create a `package.json` file, which will help manage dependencies in larger projects.

```
npm init -y
```

This creates a default `package.json` file.

3. **Create the main application file:** Inside the `hello-world` directory, create a new file named `app.js`.

4. **Write the "Hello World" code:** Open the `app.js` file and add the following code:

```js
// app.js
console.log('Hello, World!');
```

5. **Run the application:** In the terminal, navigate to the `hello-world` directory and run the following command:

```
node app.js
```

You should see the following output:

```
Hello, World!
```

## 4 Node.js Execution Model

Understanding the **Node.js Execution Model** is key to mastering how Node.js handles operations in a non-blocking, asynchronous manner while running on a single thread. This architecture enables Node.js to be lightweight, efficient, and scalable, particularly in I/O-heavy applications like web servers.

**Topics Covered:**
1. Single-threaded architecture
2. Event Loop and Call Stack
3. Callbacks, Promises, and Async/Await

---

### 4.1 Single-threaded architecture

Node.js is built around a **single-threaded event-driven architecture**, which is different from many traditional server-side technologies. In conventional multithreaded models (like in Java or PHP), each incoming request spawns a new thread. However, Node.js processes all requests on a single thread.

**How it Works:**

- The main thread handles incoming requests and delegates I/O-bound tasks (like reading a file, querying a database) to the Event Loop.
- While waiting for I/O operations to complete, the thread remains free to handle new requests.
- This non-blocking model ensures that the server remains responsive, even when dealing with many simultaneous connections.

**Advantages:**

- Efficiency in I/O Operations: The single-threaded event loop can handle thousands of concurrent connections efficiently, making Node.js suitable for I/O-bound tasks.
- Scalability: Instead of multiple threads, Node.js uses a single thread for handling all operations, with background tasks delegated to the event loop.

**Limitations:**
- **CPU-bound tasks:** Node.js is not ideal for tasks requiring heavy computation (e.g., image processing or machine learning algorithms) because these tasks block the single thread and delay other operations.
