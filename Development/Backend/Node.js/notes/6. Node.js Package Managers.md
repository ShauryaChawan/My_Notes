## Introduction to `npm`, `yarn` & `pnpm`

### 1. NPM

- NPM (Node Package Manager) is the original (default) and most widely used package manager for Node.js.
- It's maintained by the Node Foundation and comes with default Node.js installations.
- NPM uses a centralized package registry for storing and sharing packages.

#### 1.2 Advantages

- Large community and ecosystem
- Easy installation of third-party packages
- Version management with package.json and package-lock.json
- Dependency management
- Widely supported and documented

#### 1.3 Disadvantages

- Can be slower compared to newer alternatives
- Sometimes less reliable
- Non-deterministic installs (structure of node_modules may differ)

#### 1.4 Basic commands

- `npm install`
- `npm init`
- `npm run`
- `npm publish`

---

### 2. Yarn

- Yarn (Yet Another Resource Negotiator) is a package manager developed by Meta (formerly Facebook) to enhance performance and security concerns with npm.
- It uses the same npm registry for accessing/sharing packages.

#### 2.2 Advantages

- Faster and more reliable than npm
- Deterministic installs using yarn.lock
- Offline mode for package installation
- Workspaces feature for monorepo management
- Enhanced security features

#### 2.3 Disadvantages

- Smaller community compared to npm
- Learning curve for developers used to npm
- Some compatibility issues with certain npm packages

#### 2.4 Basic commands

- `yarn install`
- `yarn add`
- `yarn remove`
- `yarn run`

---

### 3. Pnpm

#### 3.1 What is pnpm?

- Pnpm (performant npm) is an advanced package manager focusing on efficiency and disk space optimization.
- It uses a unique approach with a shared global store and hard linking.

#### 3.2 Advantages

- Significant disk space savings
- Faster installation and updates
- Efficient dependency resolution
- Uses symlinks and hard links for package management
- Deterministic installs with pnpm-lock.yaml

#### 3.3 Disadvantages

- Smallest community among the three
- Potential compatibility issues with some tools/scripts expecting traditional node_modules structure
- Learning curve for developers used to npm or Yarn

#### 3.4 Basic commands

- `pnpm install`
- `pnpm add`
- `pnpm remove`
- `pnpm run`

| Lockfile              | package-lock.json      | yarn.lock               | pnpm-lock.yaml                 |
| Offline mode          | Limited                | Yes                     | Yes                            |
| Community size        | Largest                | Large                   | Smallest                       |
| Monorepo support      | Limited                | Good (Workspaces)       | Good                           |
| Package storage       | Nested in node_modules | Nested in node_modules  | Shared global store with links |
| Learning curve        | Easiest                | Moderate                | Steepest                       |
| Default with Node.js  | Yes                    | No                      | No                             |

## Installing Global and Local Packages

### 1. Local Packages

Local package installation installs a package into your project‚Äôs node_modules directory. It will only be available within that project.

```
npm install <package-name>
```

---

### 2. Global Packages

Global package installation installs a package globally on your system, making it accessible from any project.

```
npm install -g <package-name>
```

---

## Managing Dependencies (`package.json`,` package-lock.json`)

- **`package.json`**
  - The `package.json` file is a crucial part of every Node.js project. 
  - It contains metadata about the project and its dependencies.
  - Basic Structure:
  ```json
  {
    "name": "my-node-project",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "description": "A simple Node.js project",
    "main": "index.js",
    "scripts": {
      "start": "node index.js"
    },
    "dependencies": {
      "express": "^4.17.1"
    },
    "devDependencies": {
      "nodemon": "^2.0.7"
    }
  }
  ```

  - Key sections:
    - `name`: The name of the project.
    - `version`: The current version of the project.
    - `scripts`: Define scripts that can be run via `npm run <script-name>`.
    - `dependencies`: List of production dependencies that the project needs.
    - `devDependencies`: List of development dependencies used during development but not in production.

- **`package-lock.json`**
  - The package-lock.json file ensures deterministic installs by locking the exact version of dependencies (and their dependencies). 
  - This guarantees that the project behaves consistently across different environments.
  - Automatically generated when you run npm install.
  - Contains a detailed tree of installed packages and their exact versions.
  - Basic Structure:
```json
{
  "name": "my-node-project",
  "lockfileVersion": 1,
  "dependencies": {
    "express": {
      "version": "4.17.1",
      "resolved": "https://registry.npmjs.org/express/-/express-4.17.1.tgz",
      "integrity": "sha512-foobar"
    }
  }
}
```

## Semantic Versioning

Semantic Versioning (SemVer) is a convention used by NPM (and other package managers) to manage versions of packages in a standardized way. 

Versions follow the `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` format:

- `MAJOR`: Increments when there are breaking changes.
- `MINOR`: Increments when new features are added without breaking backward compatibility.
- `PATCH`: Increments when there are bug fixes or non-breaking changes.

For example, version `1.2.3`:

- `1` is the major version.
- `2` is the minor version.
- `3` is the patch version.

**Tilde (~) and Caret (^) Symbols**

- **Tilde (`~`):** Allows updates to the patch version.
  - `~1.2.3` will match versions `1.2.x` but not `1.3.0`.
- **Caret (`^`):** Allows updates to the minor version, but not the major version.
  - `^1.2.3` will match versions `1.x.x` but not `2.0.0`.
