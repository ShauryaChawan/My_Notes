## Request and Response üîÑ

- **Request Cycle:**
  - User enters a URL in the browser.
  - The browser sends a DNS request to find the IP address corresponding to the domain name.
  - The browser sends an HTTP/HTTPS request to the server at that IP address.
  - The server processes the request and sends back the requested resource (like an HTML page) as an HTTP response.
  - The browser renders the webpage for the user to view.
- **Response Cycle**:
  - The server responds with a status code (e.g., 200 for success), headers (metadata), and the requested data (like HTML content).

---

## HTTP Methods üöÄ

- `GET`: Requests data from a server.
- `POST`: Sends data to a server to create/update a resource.
- `PUT`: Replaces a resource on the server.
- `DELETE`: Removes a resource from the server.
- `HEAD`: Similar to GET, but only retrieves headers, not the body.
- `OPTIONS`: Describes the communication options for the target resource.
- `PATCH`: Applies partial modifications to a resource.

---

## Status Codes üìë

- **Informational (1xx)**: Acknowledges the request has been received (e.g., 100 Continue).
- **Success (2xx)**: The request was successful (e.g., 200 OK).
- **Redirection (3xx)**: Further action needs to be taken to complete the request (e.g., 301 Moved Permanently).
- **Client Error (4xx)**: There was an error with the request (e.g., 404 Not Found).
- **Server Error (5xx)**: The server failed to fulfill a valid request (e.g., 500 Internal Server Error).

## Components of an HTTP Request and Response?

- **Request Components**:
  - **Request Line**: Includes the HTTP method, URI, and HTTP version (e.g., `GET /index.html HTTP/1.1`).
  - **Headers**: Provide metadata about the request (e.g., `User-Agent`, `Accept`).
  - **Body**: Optional; contains data sent to the server (e.g., form data in a POST request).
- **Response Components**:
  - **Status Line**: Includes the HTTP version, status code, and reason phrase (e.g., HTTP/1.1 200 OK).
  - **Headers**: Provide metadata about the response (e.g., `Content-Type`, `Set-Cookie`).
  - **Body**: The actual content returned by the server (e.g., `HTML`, `JSON`).

- **HTTP/1.1** üåê
  - **Connection Handling**: Opens a new connection for each request-response cycle.
  - **Head-of-Line Blocking**: A single slow request can block others on the same connection.
  - **Compression**: Limited compression, primarily through Gzip and Deflate.
  - **Prioritization**: No native support for prioritizing requests.
  - **Multiplexing**: No multiplexing; each request-response pair requires its own connection.
  - **Security**: Can use HTTPS (SSL/TLS) for secure connections, but not mandatory.

- **HTTP/2** üöÄ
  - **Connection Handling**: Uses a single, persistent connection for multiple requests and responses.
  - **Head-of-Line Blocking**: Solves head-of-line blocking at the application layer, but still has it at the transport layer (TCP).
  - **Compression**: Header compression with HPACK to reduce overhead.
  - **Prioritization**: Supports prioritization of streams to optimize performance.
  - **Multiplexing**: Full multiplexing allows multiple requests and responses simultaneously over a single connection.
  - **Security**: Typically used with HTTPS, and many implementations require encryption.

- **HTTP/3** ‚ö°
  - **Connection Handling**: Uses QUIC, which establishes a single connection that can be maintained even if the network changes (e.g., switching from Wi-Fi to mobile data).
  - **Head-of-Line Blocking**: Eliminates head-of-line blocking at both the transport and application layers, thanks to QUIC.
  - **Compression**: Similar header compression as HTTP/2 but optimized with QUIC.
  - **Prioritization**: More efficient prioritization mechanisms, leveraging QUIC‚Äôs capabilities.
  - **Multiplexing**: Enhanced multiplexing with QUIC, allowing multiple streams of data without interference.
  - **Security**: Built-in encryption as QUIC is always encrypted, making HTTPS mandatory.

## Types of Headers of HTTP methods

1. **General Headers**
   - **Purpose**: Apply to both request and response messages.
   - **Examples**:
     - `Cache-Control`: Directives for caching mechanisms.
     - `Connection`: Control options for the connection (e.g., `keep-alive`).

2. **Request Headers**
   - **Purpose**: Provide information about the client or specify details about the request.
   - **Examples**:
     - `Accept`: Specifies the media types that are acceptable for the response (e.g., `text/html`).
     - `Authorization`: Contains credentials for authentication (e.g., `Bearer <token>`).
     - `User-Agent`: Identifies the client software making the request (e.g., `Mozilla/5.0`).

3. **Response Headers**
   - **Purpose**: Provide information about the server or the response itself.
   - **Examples**:
     - `Location`: Redirects the client to a different URL (e.g., `https://example.com/new-page`).
     - `Server`: Identifies the server software (e.g., `Apache/2.4.41`).
     - `Set-Cookie`: Sets cookies for the client (e.g., `sessionId=abc123; Path=/`).

4. **Entity Headers**
   - **Purpose**: Provide information about the body of the resource.
   - **Examples**:
     - `Content-Type`: Specifies the media type of the resource (e.g., `application/json`).
     - `Content-Length`: Indicates the size of the resource body in bytes (e.g., `1234`).
     - `Last-Modified`: Indicates the last modification date of the resource (e.g., `Wed, 21 Aug 2024 07:28:00 GMT`).

5. **Custom Headers**
   - **Purpose**: Application-specific headers that can be defined by the client or server for custom functionality.
   - **Examples**:
     - `X-Requested-With`: Often used to identify AJAX requests (e.g., `XMLHttpRequest`).
     - `X-Custom-Header`: An example of a custom header that might be used for specific application needs.

## What is CORS?

**CORS** is a security feature in web browsers that controls how resources from one origin (domain, protocol, or port) can be accessed by web pages from a different origin. It helps prevent unauthorized access and ensures secure interactions between different web domains.

**Key Concepts**

- **Origin**: Defined by scheme (protocol), host (domain), and port (e.g., `https://example.com:443`).

- **Same-Origin Policy**: Restricts web pages from making requests to a different origin to prevent security issues.

- **CORS Headers**:
  - **`Access-Control-Allow-Origin`**: Specifies allowed origins (e.g., `https://example.com`).
  - **`Access-Control-Allow-Methods`**: Specifies allowed HTTP methods (e.g., `GET, POST`).
  - **`Access-Control-Allow-Headers`**: Specifies allowed headers (e.g., `Content-Type, Authorization`).
  - **`Access-Control-Allow-Credentials`**: Indicates if credentials (e.g., cookies) are allowed (e.g., `true`).
  - **`Access-Control-Expose-Headers`**: Specifies which headers can be exposed to the client (e.g., `X-Custom-Header`).
  - **`Access-Control-Max-Age`**: Specifies how long the preflight response can be cached (e.g., `3600`).

- **Preflight Requests**: An OPTIONS request sent by the browser to check if the actual request is allowed, particularly for methods other than GET/POST or with custom headers.

- **Simple vs. Preflight Requests**:
  - **Simple Requests**: Methods like GET, POST with certain content types, without custom headers.
  - **Preflight Requests**: Involves methods other than GET/POST or custom headers, requiring an OPTIONS check.

**How CORS Works**

1. **Client Request**: A web page from one origin requests resources from another origin.
2. **Server Response**: The server responds with CORS headers indicating allowed origins, methods, and headers.
3. **Browser Enforcement**: The browser checks these headers and processes or blocks the request based on permissions.

**Importance**

CORS ensures secure interactions by controlling which resources can be accessed across different origins, balancing functionality with security.

## SSL and TLS üîí

- **SSL (Secure Sockets Layer)** and **TLS (Transport Layer Security)** are cryptographic protocols used to secure communications over a network. TLS is the successor to SSL. They establish an encrypted link between a server and a client (like a web browser), ensuring that data transferred between them is private and secure.
- **Working**: They work by performing a handshake, where the server and client agree on encryption methods and exchange keys to establish a secure connection.

## Concept of Idempotent

**Idempotency** in HTTP refers to an operation that can be performed multiple times without changing the result beyond the initial application. In other words, making the same request multiple times has the same effect as making it once.

**Key Points**:
- **Idempotent Methods**: Methods like `GET`, `PUT`, and `DELETE` are designed to be idempotent. For example, making a `GET` request multiple times should return the same resource without additional side effects.
- **Non-Idempotent Methods**: Methods like `POST` are not necessarily idempotent. Repeated `POST` requests might create multiple records or trigger multiple actions.
- **Why It Matters**: Idempotency ensures consistency and safety in operations, especially in scenarios involving retries or network failures. It allows clients and servers to handle requests more reliably without unintended side effects.

**Example:**
- **GET** `/resource/1`: Fetches the resource. Multiple requests return the same resource.
- **PUT** `/resource/1` with data: Updates the resource. Repeated requests with the same data result in the same state for the resource.
- **POST** `/resource`: Submits data to create a new resource. Repeated requests might create multiple resources.

Idempotency is important for designing robust APIs and ensuring predictable behavior in networked applications.
