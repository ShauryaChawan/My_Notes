## Request and Response üîÑ

- **Request Cycle:**
  - User enters a URL in the browser.
  - The browser sends a DNS request to find the IP address corresponding to the domain name.
  - The browser sends an HTTP/HTTPS request to the server at that IP address.
  - The server processes the request and sends back the requested resource (like an HTML page) as an HTTP response.
  - The browser renders the webpage for the user to view.
- **Response Cycle**:
  - The server responds with a status code (e.g., 200 for success), headers (metadata), and the requested data (like HTML content).

## HTTP Methods üöÄ

- `GET`: Requests data from a server.
- `POST`: Sends data to a server to create/update a resource.
- `PUT`: Replaces a resource on the server.
- `DELETE`: Removes a resource from the server.
- `HEAD`: Similar to GET, but only retrieves headers, not the body.
- `OPTIONS`: Describes the communication options for the target resource.
- `PATCH`: Applies partial modifications to a resource.

## Status Codes üìë

- **Informational (1xx)**: Acknowledges the request has been received (e.g., 100 Continue).
- **Success (2xx)**: The request was successful (e.g., 200 OK).
- **Redirection (3xx)**: Further action needs to be taken to complete the request (e.g., 301 Moved Permanently).
- **Client Error (4xx)**: There was an error with the request (e.g., 404 Not Found).
- **Server Error (5xx)**: The server failed to fulfill a valid request (e.g., 500 Internal Server Error).

## Components of an HTTP Request and Response?

- **Request Components**:
  - **Request Line**: Includes the HTTP method, URI, and HTTP version (e.g., `GET /index.html HTTP/1.1`).
  - **Headers**: Provide metadata about the request (e.g., `User-Agent`, `Accept`).
  - **Body**: Optional; contains data sent to the server (e.g., form data in a POST request).
- **Response Components**:
  - **Status Line**: Includes the HTTP version, status code, and reason phrase (e.g., HTTP/1.1 200 OK).
  - **Headers**: Provide metadata about the response (e.g., `Content-Type`, `Set-Cookie`).
  - **Body**: The actual content returned by the server (e.g., `HTML`, `JSON`).

## HTTP vs HTTPS

| Feature             | HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) üåê | HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) üîê |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **Security**        | Not secure, data is sent in plaintext | Secure, data is encrypted using SSL/TLS       |
| **Port**            | Uses port 80 by default               | Uses port 443 by default                      |
| **Data Encryption** | No encryption                         | Encrypts data in transit                      |
| **Certificate**     | No certificate required               | Requires an SSL/TLS certificate               |
| **Performance**     | Slightly faster due to no encryption  | Slightly slower due to encryption overhead    |
| **Trust**           | Less trusted by users and browsers    | More trusted, often indicated by a padlock icon in the browser |
| **SEO Impact**      | No positive impact on SEO             | Positive impact on SEO; preferred by search engines |
| **Use Cases**       | Suitable for non-sensitive data       | Required for sensitive data (e.g., payments, login) |


## HTTP1 vs HTTP2 vs HTTP3 ‚öñÔ∏è

- **HTTP/1.1** üåê
  - **Connection Handling**: Opens a new connection for each request-response cycle.
  - **Head-of-Line Blocking**: A single slow request can block others on the same connection.
  - **Compression**: Limited compression, primarily through Gzip and Deflate.
  - **Prioritization**: No native support for prioritizing requests.
  - **Multiplexing**: No multiplexing; each request-response pair requires its own connection.
  - **Security**: Can use HTTPS (SSL/TLS) for secure connections, but not mandatory.

- **HTTP/2** üöÄ
  - **Connection Handling**: Uses a single, persistent connection for multiple requests and responses.
  - **Head-of-Line Blocking**: Solves head-of-line blocking at the application layer, but still has it at the transport layer (TCP).
  - **Compression**: Header compression with HPACK to reduce overhead.
  - **Prioritization**: Supports prioritization of streams to optimize performance.
  - **Multiplexing**: Full multiplexing allows multiple requests and responses simultaneously over a single connection.
  - **Security**: Typically used with HTTPS, and many implementations require encryption.

- **HTTP/3** ‚ö°
  - **Connection Handling**: Uses QUIC, which establishes a single connection that can be maintained even if the network changes (e.g., switching from Wi-Fi to mobile data).
  - **Head-of-Line Blocking**: Eliminates head-of-line blocking at both the transport and application layers, thanks to QUIC.
  - **Compression**: Similar header compression as HTTP/2 but optimized with QUIC.
  - **Prioritization**: More efficient prioritization mechanisms, leveraging QUIC‚Äôs capabilities.
  - **Multiplexing**: Enhanced multiplexing with QUIC, allowing multiple streams of data without interference.
  - **Security**: Built-in encryption as QUIC is always encrypted, making HTTPS mandatory.

## SSL and TLS üîí

- **SSL (Secure Sockets Layer)** and **TLS (Transport Layer Security)** are cryptographic protocols used to secure communications over a network. TLS is the successor to SSL. They establish an encrypted link between a server and a client (like a web browser), ensuring that data transferred between them is private and secure.
- **Working**: They work by performing a handshake, where the server and client agree on encryption methods and exchange keys to establish a secure connection.

## `GET` Method

- **Purpose**: Retrieve data from a specified resource.
- **Parameters**:
  - **URL**: The endpoint from which to retrieve data.
  - **Query Parameters**: Optional key-value pairs appended to the URL (e.g., `?search=keyword`).
