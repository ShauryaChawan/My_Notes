## Introduction

JavaScript Variables can be declared in 4 ways:

- Automatically
- Using `var`
- Using `let`
- Using `const`

**Example:** Automatically

![alt text](../imgs/2.1.png)

**NOTE:** It is considered good programming practice to always declare variables before use.

**Example:** Using `var`

```js
var x = 5;
var y = 6;
var z = x + y;
```

**NOTE:**
- The `var` keyword was used in all JavaScript code from 1995 to 2015.
- The `let` and `const` keywords were added to JavaScript in 2015.
- The `var` keyword should only be used in code written for older browsers.

**Example:** Using `let`

```js
let x = 5;
let y = 6;
let z = x + y;
```

**Example:** Using `const`

```js
const x = 5;
const y = 6;
const z = x + y;
```

```js
const price1 = 5;
const price2 = 6;
let total = price1 + price2;
```

### When to Use var, let, or const?

1. Always declare variables
2. Always use `const` if the value should not be changed
3. Always use `const` if the type should not be changed (Arrays and Objects)
4. Only use `let` if you can't use `const`
5. Only use `var` if you MUST support old browsers.

## JS Identifiers

The general rules for constructing names for variables (unique identifiers) are:

- Names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs.
- Names must begin with a letter.
- Names can also begin with $ and _ (but we will not use it in this tutorial).
- Names are case sensitive (y and Y are different variables).
- Reserved words (like JavaScript keywords) cannot be used as names.

**Exmaple:**

```js
let firstName = "John";
let _lastName = "Doe";
let $totalAmount = 100;
let version2 = "v2.0";
let camelCaseExample = "This is camel case";
let PascalCaseExample = "This is Pascal case";
```

## Multiple Declaration in 1 Statement

```js
let person = "John Doe", carName = "Volvo", price = 200;

// OR

let person = "John Doe",
carName = "Volvo",
price = 200;
```

## Re-Declaring JavaScript Variables
If you re-declare a JavaScript variable declared with var, it will not lose its value.

The variable carName will still have the value "Volvo" after the execution of these statements:

```js
var carName = "Volvo";
var carName;
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è NOTE ‚ö†Ô∏è**
You cannot re-declare a variable declared with `let` or `const`.
This will not work ‚ùå:

```js
let carName = "Volvo";
let carName;
```

## The `let` keyword


## The `const` keyword
