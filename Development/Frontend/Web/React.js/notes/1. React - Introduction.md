## What is React?
React, sometimes referred to as a frontend JavaScript framework, is a JavaScript library created by Facebook.

React is a tool for building UI components.

## How does React Work?

- React creates a VIRTUAL DOM in memory.
  - Instead of manipulating the browser's DOM directly, React creates a virtual DOM in memory, where it does all the necessary manipulating, before making the changes in the browser DOM.
- React only changes what needs to be changed!
  - React finds out what changes have been made, and changes only what needs to be changed.
