## HTML Headings

- HTML headings are defined with the `<h1>` to `<h6>` tags.
- `<h1>` defines the most important heading. `<h6>` defines the least important heading.

**Note**: Browsers automatically add some white space (a margin) before and after a heading.

```
<h1>Heading 1</h1>
<h2>Heading 2</h2>
<h3>Heading 3</h3>
<h4>Heading 4</h4>
<h5>Heading 5</h5>
<h6>Heading 6</h6>
```
**Output:**

<h1>Heading 1</h1>
<h2>Heading 2</h2>
<h3>Heading 3</h3>
<h4>Heading 4</h4>
<h5>Heading 5</h5>
<h6>Heading 6</h6>

## HTML Paragraphs

- The HTML `<p>` element defines a paragraph.
- A paragraph always starts on a new line, and browsers automatically add some white space (a margin) before and after a paragraph.

```
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
<p>This is another paragraph.</p>
```
**Output:**
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
<p>This is another paragraph.</p>

You cannot be sure how HTML will be displayed.
Large or small screens, and resized windows will create different results.
With HTML, you cannot change the display by adding extra spaces or extra lines in your HTML code.
The browser will automatically remove any extra spaces and lines when the page is displayed:
```
<p>
This paragraph
contains a lot of lines
in the source code,
but the browser
ignores it.
</p>

<p>
This paragraph
contains         a lot of spaces
in the source         code,
but the        browser
ignores it.
</p>
```
**Output:**
```
This paragraph contains a lot of lines in the source code, but the browser ignores it.

This paragraph contains a lot of spaces in the source code, but the browser ignores it.

The number of lines in a paragraph depends on the size of the browser window. If you resize the browser window, the number of lines in this paragraph will change.
```

## HTML Text Formatting

Formatting elements were designed to display special types of text:
- `<b>` - Bold text
- `<strong>` - Important text
- `<i>` - Italic text
- `<em>` - Emphasized text
- `<mark>` - Marked text
- `<small>` - Smaller text
- `<del>` - Deleted text
- `<ins>` - Inserted text
- `<sub>` - Subscript text
- `<sup>` - Superscript text

### HTML `<b>` and `<strong>` Elements

- The HTML `<b>` element defines bold text, without any extra importance.

```
<p>This text is <b>bold</b></p>
```
**Output:**
<p>This text is <b>bold</b></p>

- The HTML `<strong>` element defines text with strong importance. The content inside is typically displayed in bold.

```
<strong>This text is important!</strong>
```
**Output:**
<p><strong>This text is important!</strong></p>

<hr/>

### HTML `<i>` and `<em>` Elements

- The HTML `<i>` element defines a part of text in an alternate voice or mood. The content inside is typically displayed in italic.

**Tip:** The `<i>` tag is often used to indicate a technical term, a phrase from another language, a thought, a ship name, etc.

```
This text is <i>italic</i>
```
**Output:**
<p>This text is <i>italic.</i></p>

- The HTML <em> element defines emphasized text. The content inside is typically displayed in italic.

**Tip:** A screen reader will pronounce the words in <em> with an emphasis, using verbal stress.

```
<em>This text is emphasized</em>
```
**Output:**
<p><em>This text is emphasized</em></p>

<hr/>

### HTML `<small>` Element

The HTML `<small>` element defines smaller text:
```
<small>This is some smaller text.</small>
```
**Output:**
<p><small>This is some <small>smaller text.</small></p>

<hr/>

### HTML `<mark>` Element

The HTML `<mark>` element defines text that should be marked or highlighted:
```
<p>Do not forget to buy <mark>milk</mark> today.</p>
```
**Output:**
<p>Do not forget to buy <mark>milk</mark> today.</p>
