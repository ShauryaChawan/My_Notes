## Links Syntax

The HTML `<a>` tag defines a hyperlink. It has the following syntax:

```html
<a href="url">link text</a>
```

By default, links will appear as follows in all browsers:

- An unvisited link is underlined and blue
- A visited link is underlined and purple
- An active link is underlined and red

## Links `target` Attribute

By default, the linked page will be displayed in the current browser window. To change this, you must specify another target for the link.

The `target` attribute specifies where to open the linked document.

The `target` attribute can have one of the following values:

- `_self` - Default. Opens the document in the same window/tab as it was clicked
- `_blank` - Opens the document in a new window or tab
- `_parent` - Opens the document in the parent frame
- `_top` - Opens the document in the full body of the window

**Example:**

```html
<a href="https://www.w3schools.com/" target="_blank">Visit W3Schools!</a>
```

## Absolute URLs vs. Relative URLs

Both examples above are using an absolute URL (a full web address) in the `href` attribute.

A local link (a link to a page within the same website) is specified with a relative URL (without the "https://www" part):

```html
<h2>Absolute URLs</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.w3.org/">W3C</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.google.com/">Google</a></p>

<h2>Relative URLs</h2>
<p><a href="html_images.asp">HTML Images</a></p>
<p><a href="/css/default.asp">CSS Tutorial</a></p>
```

## Use Image as Link

To use an image as a link, just put the `<img>` tag inside the `<a>` tag:

```html
<a href="default.asp">
<img src="smiley.gif" alt="HTML tutorial" style="width:42px;height:42px;">
</a>
```

## Link to an Email Address

Use `mailto:` inside the `href` attribute to create a link that opens the user's email program (to let them send a new email):

```html
<a href="mailto:someone@example.com">Send email</a>
```
