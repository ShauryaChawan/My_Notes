<h2>Multiprogramming</h2>


<h2>Multiprocessing</h2>


<h2>Multitasking</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    Multitasking is the ability of an operating system to execute multiple tasks
    (processes) concurrently by rapidly switching between them.
  </li>
  <li>
    This creates the impression that multiple tasks are running simultaneously.
  </li>
  <li>
    Example: Using a smartphone to listen to music while browsing the web and
    receiving text messages.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Multithreading</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    Multithreading is a programming concept where a single process is divided
    into multiple threads that can execute concurrently.
  </li>
  <li>Threads share the same memory space but can run independently.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Differences</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    Multiprogramming vs Multiprocessing:
    <ul>
      <li>Multiprogramming uses a single CPU to run multiple programs.</li>
      <li>
        Multiprocessing uses multiple CPUs or cores to run multiple programs
        simultaneously.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Multiprogramming vs Multitasking:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Multiprogramming focuses on running multiple programs concurrently.
      </li>
      <li>
        Multitasking is a broader concept that includes both process-level and
        thread-level concurrency.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Multiprocessing vs Multithreading:
    <ul>
      <li>Multiprocessing involves multiple CPUs working on separate tasks.</li>
      <li>
        Multithreading involves multiple threads within a single process sharing
        the same memory space.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Multiprocessing vs Multitasking:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Multiprocessing uses multiple CPUs to execute tasks simultaneously.
      </li>
      <li>
        Multitasking rapidly switches between tasks to create the illusion of
        simultaneous execution, potentially on a single CPU.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Multitasking vs Multithreading:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Multitasking deals with multiple processes with separate memory spaces.
      </li>
      <li>
        Multithreading deals with multiple threads within a single process
        sharing the same memory space.
      </li>
    </ul>
