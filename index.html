    <tr>
      <td>Definition</td>
      <td>
        A legacy class that implements a synchronized hash table for key-value
        pairs.
      </td>
      <td>
        A hash table and linked list implementation of the
        <code>Map</code> interface that maintains insertion order.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Synchronization</td>
      <td>
        Synchronized. It is thread-safe, meaning multiple threads can access it
        concurrently without corrupting data.
      </td>
      <td>
        Not synchronized. It is not thread-safe and requires external
        synchronization for use in concurrent contexts.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Null Keys/Values</td>
      <td>Does not allow null keys or null values.</td>
      <td>Allows one null key and multiple null values.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Ordering</td>
      <td>
        Does not guarantee any specific order of elements. The order is based on
        the hash codes of the elements.
      </td>
      <td>
        Maintains elements in the order they were inserted, due to the linked
        list component.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Performance</td>
      <td>Generally slower due to synchronization overhead.</td>
      <td>
        Provides slightly slower performance than <code>HashMap</code> due to
        additional overhead of maintaining the linked list, but generally faster
        than <code>Hashtable</code>.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Legacy Status</td>
      <td>Introduced in JDK 1.0. Considered a legacy class.</td>
      <td>
        Introduced in JDK 1.2 as part of the Collections Framework. Not a legacy
        class.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Thread-Safety</td>
      <td>Built-in thread safety due to synchronized methods.</td>
      <td>
        Not thread-safe. Use <code>Collections.synchronizedMap</code> for
        thread-safe operations.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Iterator</td>
      <td>The iterator is not fail-fast.</td>
      <td>
        The iterator is fail-fast, meaning it will throw a
        <code>ConcurrentModificationException</code> if the map is modified
        while iterating.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Use Case</td>
      <td>
        Suitable for legacy code that requires a thread-safe implementation of a
        hash table.
      </td>
      <td>
        Preferred when you need a map that maintains insertion order with better
        performance than <code>Hashtable</code>.
      </td>
